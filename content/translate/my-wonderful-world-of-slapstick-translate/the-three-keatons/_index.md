　　多年来，我的脸被称为“扑克脸（sour puss）”、“冷面”、“冻脸”、“伟大的石头脸”，信不信由你，还有“悲剧面具”。另一方面，那位和蔼的评论家，已故的James Agee，把我的脸描述为“几乎和林肯的脸一样是早期美国的原型，它令人难忘，英俊，几乎是美丽的。”虽然我很高兴，但我无法想象那位伟大的“劈柴工”（rail splitter）会有什么反应。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Down through the years my face has been called a sour puss, a dead pan, a frozen face, The Great Stone Face, and, believe it or not, "a tragic mask." On the other hand that kindly critic, the late James Agee, described my face as ranking "almost with Lincoln's as an early American archetype, it was haunting, handsome, almost beautiful." I cant imagine what the great rail splitter's reaction would have been to this, though I sure was pleased.
</font></details>

　　<font color=Orange>puss：俚语(英式)，意思是“面子”。sour puss：一种酸的、不高兴的、阴沉的面部表情，扑克脸。</font>

　　<font color=Orange>rail splitter：林肯的绰号。</font>

　　人们可能会高谈阔论，也可能会轻描淡写，但在我60年的演艺生涯中，我的脸一直是我宝贵的标志。六十年是正确的，因为我是在1899年，当时我还不到四岁，就正式加入了我父母的杂耍表演。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
People may talk it up or talk it down, but my face has been a valuable trade-mark for me during my sixty years in show business. Sixty years is right, for it was in 1899, when I was not quite four years old, that I officially joined my parents' vaudeville act.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　如果你认为60年是你生命中很长的一段时间，你应该从事演艺事业。对大多数演员来说，上周三已经是很久以前的事了。年轻人谈论宫殿里的歌舞杂耍表演盛况，仿佛这些都是在戏剧史的黎明时期。我刚开始的时候，歌舞杂耍表演才刚刚开始取代吟游诗人的表演，成为这个国家最受欢迎的娱乐节目。这座宫殿甚至还没有建成。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
And if you think sixty years is a long time in your life you should be in show business. Last Wednesday is a long time ago to most actors. The young ones talk of the great vaudeville days at the Palace as though these came at the dawn of theatrical history. When I started, vaudeville was just beginning to replace the minstrel show as the country's favorite entertainment. The Palace was not even built.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　如果我说我在1899年“正式加入”了我父母的家庭活动，那是因为我父亲总是坚持说，实际上从我出生的那一天起，我就一直试图非正式地融入家庭活动——意思是未经要求的、不想要的、没有要求的。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
If I say I "officially joined" my folks' act in 1899 it is because my father always insisted that I'd been trying to get into the family act unofficially—meaning unasked, unwanted, and unbilled—practically from the day I was born.
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　因为没有保姆，妈妈就把我放在衣柜箱子的收银台上，她和爸爸一起在舞台上工作。据他说，我一爬起来就走向了舞台灯光。“当巴斯特学会走路时，”他总是骄傲地向所有感兴趣和不感兴趣的人解释说，“没人能抓住他。他会在舞台两侧（Wings）跳上跳下，发出很大的噪音，挡住每个人的路。让他和我们一起上台，这样我们就可以看着他了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Having no baby sitter, my mother parked me in the till of a wardrobe trunk while she worked on the stage with Pop. According to him, the moment I could crawl I headed for the footlights. "And when Buster learned to walk," he always proudly explained to all who were interested and many who weren't, "there was no holding him. He would jump up and down in the wings, make plenty of noise, and get in everyone's way. It seemed easier to let him come out with us on the stage where we could keep an eye on him.
</font></details>

　　<font color=Orange>wings：舞台被帘幕或布景遮挡的侧面。</font>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“一开始我告诉他不要动。要靠在旁边的墙上，呆在那里。但有一天，我突发奇想，想把他打扮成我的样子，一个舞台上的爱尔兰人，戴着吓人的假发，留着大胡子，穿着花哨的背心和大裤子。很快，他开始模仿我做的每一件事，逗得我哈哈大笑。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"At first I told him not to move. He was to lean against the side wall and stay there. But one day I got the idea of dressing him up like myself as a stage Irishman with a fright wig, slugger whiskers, fancy vest, and over-size pants. Soon he was imitating everything I did, and getting laughs.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“但在我们周一在特拉华州威尔明顿比尔·多克斯塔德（Bill Dockstader）剧院的首场演出中，他一无所获。Dockstader让我别参加演出。但他在星期三为孩子们安排了一场特别的日场，尽管还不太清楚，但他们可能会被巴斯特的滑稽动作逗乐。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"But he got nothing at all at the first Monday show we played at Bill Dockstader's Theatre in Wilmington, Delaware. Dockstader told me to leave him out of the act. But he had a special matinee for kiddies on Wednesday and suggested that children, knowing no better, might be amused by Buster's antics."
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　星期三，比尔注意到孩子的父母似乎也被逗乐了，于是他建议我参加所有演出。爸爸说他不想让我参加夜场演出，因为我得像小孩子一样休息。Dockstader随后提出每周额外支付10美元的建议。我父亲同意试一试。从那以后，我日场夜场都在表演，上午可以休息。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
On Wednesday Bill noticed that their parents also seemed amused and suggested I go on at all performances. Pop said he didn't want to use me in the night show as I had to get my rest like any small child. Dockstader then offered to pay the act ten dollars a week extra. My father agreed to try it. I had no trouble sleeping through the morning and played night and day with the act from then on.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　即使在我早年的时候，我们的表演就有最粗野杂耍的名声。这是爸爸和我做的一系列有趣实验的结果。他一开始把我抱到舞台上，然后把我扔在地板上。接着他开始跟我一起擦地板。当我对此毫无反应时，他开始把我扔进布景，扔到舞台的两侧，然后把我扔到管弦乐队的大鼓上。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Even in my early days our turn established a reputation for being the roughest in vaudeville. This was the result of a series of interesting experiments Pop made with me. He began these by carrying me out on the stage and dropping me on the floor. Next he started wiping up the floor with me. When I gave no sign of minding this he began throwing me through the scenery, out into the wings, and dropping me down on the bass drum in the orchestra pit.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　前排的观众都很惊讶，因为我没有哭。这没什么神秘的，我没有哭是因为我没有受伤。小男孩都喜欢被父亲欺负，他们也是天生的杂技演员。因为我也是天生的杂耍演员，所以当我听到观众们的喘气、笑声和掌声时，我忽略了可能会有的磕磕碰碰或瘀伤。还有一件事：小孩子跌倒后，他们不会走多远，我想心理学家会称之为自我催眠。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The people out front were amazed because I did not cry. There was nothing mysterious about this. I did not cry because I wasn't hurt. All little boys like to be roughhoused by their fathers. They are also natural tumblers and acrobats. Because I was also a born hambone, I ignored any bumps or bruises I may have got at first on hearing audiences gasp, laugh, and applaud. There is one more thing: little kids when they fall haven't very far to go. I suppose a psychologist would call it a case of self-hypnosis.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在我变得比橡皮糖（gumdrop）大得多之前，我曾在我们的表演（三基顿）中扮演“人类拖把”。我首先注意到的是，每当我微笑或让观众怀疑我玩得开心时，他们似乎就不像往常那样大笑了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Before I was much bigger than a gumdrop I was being featured in our act, The Three Keatons, as "The Human Mop." One of the first things I noticed was that whenever I smiled or let the audience suspect how much I was enjoying myself they didn't seem to laugh as much as usual.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我猜人们永远不希望人类拖把、抹布、麻袋或足球会对他所遭受的一切感到高兴。不管怎么说，我是故意让自己显得可怜、丢脸、苦恼、苦恼、困惑、无奈。其他一些喜剧演员可以对着自己的笑话笑出来，但我不行，公众也不会容忍。这对我来说没什么，我这辈子最开心的事就是人们看着我并对彼此说：“看看这个可怜的家伙，wilya？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I guess people just never do expect any human mop, dishrag, beanbag, or football to be pleased by what is being done to him. At any rate it was on purpose that I started looking miserable, humiliated, hounded, and haunted, bedeviled, bewildered, and at my wit's end. Some other comedians can get away with laughing at their own gags. Not me. The public just will not stand for it. And that is all right with me. All of my life I have been happiest when the folks watching me said to each other, "Look at the poor dope, wilya?"
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　由于我在舞台上和银幕上的样子，公众自然认为我在个人生活中也感到绝望和不被爱。从我记事起，我一直认为自己是非常幸运的人。从一开始，我就被一群有趣的人包围着，他们热爱乐趣，知道如何创造乐趣。我有过一些无聊的时刻，但没有太多悲伤和失败的时刻。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Because of the way I looked on the stage and screen the public naturally assumed that I felt hopeless and unloved in my personal life. Nothing could be farther from the fact As long back as I can remember I have considered myself a fabulously lucky man. From the beginning I was surrounded by interesting people who loved fun and knew how to create it. I've had few dull moments and not too many sad and defeated ones.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我这样说并不是在忽视我经历过的艰难和坎坷的岁月。但我从小就不认为生活很轻松。我总是希望为了我的钱而努力工作，而不是得到我所挣到的。在我看来，糟糕的日子太少了，只有一个喜欢自怨自艾的爱发牢骚的人才会抱怨。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
In saying this I am by no means overlooking the rough and rocky years I've lived through. But I was not brought up thinking life would be easy. I always expected to work hard for my money and to get nothing I did not earn. And the bad years, it seems to me, were so few that only a dyed-in-the-wool grouch who enjoys feeling sorry for himself would complain of them.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我的父母是我第一个幸运。我不记得在我成长的岁月里他们有过一次关于金钱或其他任何事情发生争吵。而且，两人都是顽强的个人主义者。我是他们的同伴，也是他们的孩子。从我十岁起，他们和其他表演者就不再把我当作小男孩，而是把我当成一个成熟的表演者。这难道不是大多数孩子想要的吗：被接受，被允许分享父母的担忧和问题？当然，像我这样年纪的人很难确切地说出他小时候的感受、想法和想要的东西。但在我看来，我既享受着童年的自由，也享受着童年的特权，当然大部分都是这样，同时我也享受着比其他男孩和女孩早几年被视为成年的兴奋。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
My parents were my first bit of great luck. I cannot recall one argument that they had about money or anything else during the years I was growing up. Yet both were rugged individualists. I was their partner, however, as well as their child. And from the time I was ten both they and the other actors on the bill treated me not as a little boy, but as an adult and a full-fledged performer. Isn't that what most children want: to be accepted, to be allowed to share in their parents' concerns and problems? It is difficult, of course, for a man of my age to say with certainty what he felt and thought and wanted as a little kid. But it seems to me that I enjoyed both the freedom and privileges of childhood, certainly most of them, and also the thrill of being treated as full grown years before other boys and girls.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　妈妈和爸爸都不表露感情，但在那个年代，没有多少孩子期望他们的父母那样，你应该顺从他们，当我不服管教时，我的屁股被狠狠地教训了。没人指望我喜欢，也没人在乎我喜欢不喜欢，他们用一个正常淘气男孩所理解的方式告诉我如何守规矩，当我没能抓住要点时，我得到了另一次教训。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Neither Mom nor Pop was demonstrative, but not many children expected that of their parents in those days. You were supposed to please them. When I disobeyed orders I got a good clout over the backside. Nobody expected me to like it, or cared whether I did or not. The clout told me in the one way a normal and mischievous boy understands to behave myself. When I failed to get the point I got another clout.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我七岁以后，爸爸会因为我在舞台上表演时的不当行为而惩罚我。他知道我太骄傲了，我能忍住不哭不叫。我不认为我父亲残忍，他只是觉得对我这样一个精神小伙来说，做太多事却不受惩罚是不好的。从那以后，我观察到的一切都没有让我有理由认为他是错的。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After I was seven, Pop would punish me for misbehaving while we were working on the stage. He knew I was too proud of being able to take it to yell or cry. I don t think my father had an ounce of cruelty in him. He just didn't think it was good for a boy as full of beans as I was to get away with too much. And nothing that I have observed since gives me reason to think he was wrong.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　顺便说一句，对于我最后一次在台下被教训，我要感谢埃尔西·詹尼斯（Elsie Janis），她也是一名儿童表演者。当时埃尔西十三岁，大我六岁。那个星期，我们和她在中西部一个避暑胜地的剧院演出。有一天，她提议从附近的农场偷些玉米。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
For my last off-stage licking, by the way, I can thank Elsie Janis, then a child performer herself. At this time Elsie was thirteen, a half-dozen years older than I. Our act and hers were playing at a Midwestern summer-resort theatre that week. One day she suggested stealing some corn from a farm close by.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们俩都不知道怎么煮玉米，我们在尝试时还生了很多烟，结果农场主抓住了我们，并向我父亲和埃尔西的母亲比尔鲍尔太太（Bierbower）说了我们的罪行。那天爸爸狠狠揍了我一顿，但我始终不知道埃尔西的母亲是否惩罚了她。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Neither of us knew how to cook corn, and we made so much smoke when we tried that the farmer caught us and reported the crime to my father and Elsie's mother, Mrs. Bierbower. Pop sure whacked me good that day, but I never found out whether or not Elsie's mother punished her.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　即使在13岁的时候，埃尔西的才华就表明她将很快达到我们这个行业的巅峰，仅仅四年她就做到了，当时她主演了百老汇的热门剧目《范德比尔特杯》（Vanderbilt Cup）。顺便说一句，我曾见过一些舞台上的母亲，她们非常愤怒，歇斯底里，像狮子一样暴跳如雷，耳朵都要垂下来了，但从来没有见过像比尔鲍尔（Bierbower）夫人那样竭尽全力哄女儿的母亲。即使在那时，当埃尔西·詹尼斯在舞台上唱歌时，比尔鲍尔太太在舞台两侧看着她，脸上带着心醉魂迷的神情，和她一起唱每一个音符，好像被感动了一样。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Even at thirteen, Elsie's talent made it obvious that she would quickly reach the top of our profession which she did just four years later when she was starred in the Broadway hit, The Vanderbilt Cup. Incidentally I have seen stage mothers who were furious, hysterical, given to lioness-like rages and ear-bending tantrums but never another like Mrs. Bierbower for do-or-die energy in putting a daughter over. Even then, when Elsie Janis sang on the stage, Mrs. Bierbower, watching from the wings with a hypnotized look on her face, sang every note with her as though transported.

　　我的母亲米拉·卡特勒·基顿（Myra Cutler Keaton）身高4英尺11英寸，体重90磅，出生在演艺界，是F. L.&nbsp;卡特勒（F. L. Cutler）的女儿，卡特勒是卡特勒-布莱恩特10美分秀（Cutler-Bryant 10-cent Show）的老板之一，这是一套旅行帐篷装备。在我母亲11岁之前，她就会演奏小提琴、钢琴和小号。后来，她成为美国第一个在舞台上演奏萨克斯管的女演员。但妈妈可以选择从事演艺事业，也可以不做。由于她小时候和父亲的嘉年华一起旅行，后来又在他们的杂耍表演中与父亲搭档，所以她直到快三十岁时才学会做饭，她厨艺很好。在她的一生中，比起其他职业，如体育、娱乐、工作，或者我们在演艺界所说的娱乐，妈妈更喜欢玩竞叫皮纳克尔（auction pinochle）。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
My own mother, Myra Cutler Keaton, was four feet eleven inches tall, weighed ninety pounds, and was born into show business, being the daughter of F. L. Cutler, one of the owners of the Cutler-Bryant 10-cent Show, a traveling tent outfit. Before my mother was eleven she could play the bull fiddle, the piano, and the cornet Later on, she became the first woman stage performer in the United States to play a saxophone. But Mom could take show business or leave it alone. Due to traveling with her father's carnival-on-wheels as a girl, then later as Pop's partner in their vaudeville act, she never learned to cook until she was almost thirty years old. Then she did all right by us in the kitchen. But all of her life Mom preferred playing auction pinochle to any other occupation, sport, amusement, employment, or, as we say in show business, divertisement.

　　我的父亲乔·基顿（Joe Keaton）身高5英尺11英寸，是个天生的喜剧演员，也是个优雅的古怪舞者和软鞋舞者。他是我见过的最擅长栽跟头的人。他也是全国最好的打手（rough-and-tumble fighters）之一。和我母亲不同，他不是为演艺事业而生的，他必须战斗，说句俏皮话，用蹄子闯进去，但一旦到了那里，他就认为自己是一个成功到达应许之地的人。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
My father, Joe Keaton, was five foot eleven, a natural comic and a fine eccentric and soft-shoe dancer. He was the most gifted man at taking a fall I ever saw in action. He was also one of the country's best rough-and-tumble fighters. Unlike my mother, he was not born to show business. He had to fight, wisecrack, and hoof his way into it. But once there, he counted himself a man who had made it all of the way to the Promised Land.

　　然而，尽管他喜欢当演员，品尝掌声，听他创造的笑声，但这并不是他生活的主要内容。最重要的是，爸爸是一个乐观的人，他做这件事肯定是对的，几乎每周都要从一个城市到另一个城市，这意味着他会不断地与他的朋友们进行令人惊喜的邂逅。他的朋友们是我们在西雅图、波士顿、路易斯维尔和新奥尔良合作过的表演者。对我爸爸来说，每个星期都是回家的日子。对他来说，我们演出的每一个城市都像是回到他的家乡印第安纳州的泰瑞豪特。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Yet, as much as he loved being an actor, tasting the applause, and listening to the laughter he created, it was not the main thing in life for him. Above all else, Pop was a convivial soul, and he sure was in the right business for it. Traveling from city to city almost every week meant constant and pleasant surprise encounters with his pals, actors we'd worked with on bills in Seattle, Boston, Louisville, New Orleans. Every week was old home week for my Pop. Every town we played was, for him, like being back in his home town of Terre Haute, Indiana.

　　爸爸在俄克拉荷马州认识威尔·罗杰斯，哈里·胡迪尼是他第一个生意伙伴。他是弗雷德·斯通（Fred Stone）、乔治·M·科汉（George M.Cohan）和他快乐的父亲杰瑞（Jerry）、比利·B·范（Billy B.Van）、杰克·诺沃思（Jack Norworth）、艾尔·乔森（Al Jolson）、麦克林提尔（Mclntire）和希思（Heath）、格斯·爱德华兹（Gus Edwards）、埃文喜剧四部（Avon Cometic Four）、多伊尔（Doyle）和迪克森（Dixon）的朋友和崇拜者。在我们演出的每个城市，他都会与这些有才华的人重聚。晚上会有很长一段时间，喝啤酒，吃免费午餐，交换欢乐的回忆。如果由于某种可怕的意外，账单上的每个人都是陌生人，那么爸爸就属于“麋鹿”和其他十几个兄弟组织，这些组织的成员在他们的俱乐部里张开双臂，畅饮啤酒，欢迎他。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop knew Will Rogers in Oklahoma. Harry Houdini was his first business partner. He was the pal and admirer of Fred Stone, George M. Cohan and his jovial father, Jerry, Billy B. Van, Jack Norworth, Al Jolson, Mclntyre and Heath, Gus Edwards, the Avon Comedy Four, Doyle and Dixon, and just about everyone else who was around and up and doing in the old two-a-day days. In each town we played he would have reunions with some of these talented men. There would be long nightly sessions of drinking beer, eating free lunch, and swapping hilarious reminiscences. And if by some horrible accident everybody on the bill was a stranger Pop belonged to the Elks and a dozen other fraternal organizations whose members everywhere welcomed him at their clubhouses with open arms and free-flowing beer spigots.

　　爸爸以他的父亲、祖父和曾祖父的名字命名为乔瑟夫。和他们一样，他是长子中的长子。但之前的三个乔·基顿都是诚实、勤劳的中西部农民和磨坊主。爸爸的性格在他还是孩子时就很不寻常，以至于在他12岁前，我祖父就放弃了建立面粉厂王朝的所有希望。那时，爸爸从学校逃走，在特雷豪特市中心成为擦鞋和台球房的常客。我父亲因为和比他大的男孩抢最好的街角而被打得眼睛发黑，很快他就被人戏称为“迪克死亡之眼”。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop was named Joseph after his father, grandfather, and greatgrandfather. Like each of them he was the first son of a first son. But the three earlier Joe Keatons were honest, hard-working Midwestern farmers and millers. Pop's personality was so unusual even as a boy that before he was twelve my grandfather gave up all hope of starting a flour-mill dynasty. By that time Pop had run away from school to become a bootblack and poolroom habitue in the downtown section of Terre Haute. My father got so many black eyes fighting with bigger boy bootblacks for the best street corners that he soon was nicknamed "Dick Deadeyes."

　　当他长大到不能靠擦鞋为生时，他回到了家里的工厂，但不是去工作。他大部分时间都在招待那些雇工和等待收割玉米的农民。他的节目包括歌曲、诙谐的语录、做鬼脸和翻跟头（当时被称为后空翻）。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When he got too big to shine shoes for a living Pop returned to the family mill—but not to work. He spent most of his time entertaining the hired help and the farmers who were waiting for their corn to be ground. His repertory included songs, witty sayings, making funny faces and doing flip-flaps, as back somersaults were then called.

　　基顿爷爷被逗乐了，但还不够。1889年，一位蓄着长胡子、想象力更丰富的发起人带着俄克拉荷马州法案来到特雷豪特，爸爸刚刚过了投票年龄。他告诉人们，自耕农可以在这片新土地上获得巨大的财富。他告诉他的听众应该凑点钱。如果他们跟着他，他会告诉他们如何征服自然，如何战胜试图抢劫他们的狡猾角色，并帮助他们解决最顽强的拓荒者必须面对的各种其他问题。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Grandpa Keaton was amused, but not enough. Pop was just over voting age in 1889 when Oklahoma Bill, a promoter with a long beard and a longer imagination, came to Terre Haute and told of the great fortunes homesteaders could make in that new territory. His listeners ought to get some money together, he said. If they followed him he would show them how to conquer the elements, outwit any shifty characters who tried to rob them, and help them cope with various other problems the hardiest of pioneers had to face.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我父亲很感兴趣，没费多大力气基顿爷爷就同意这个计划。他给了爸爸一百美元现金，并把他那把值得信赖的温彻斯特步枪交给了爸爸。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
My father was intrigued, and Grandpa Keaton didn't have to be coaxed very much before he agreed to back the plan. He gave Pop one hundred dollars in cash and handed over his trusty Winchester rifle.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“如果俄克拉荷马州法案和我想的一样，”他对爸爸说，“你会比我在特雷豪特更需要这把枪。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
If Oklahoma Bill is what I think he is," he told Pop, "you'll need that gun more than I do around here in Terre Haute."
</font></details>

　　尽管基顿爷爷持怀疑态度，但爸爸确实获得了四分之一的处女地，并设法持有了足够长的时间，最后以1000美元的价格出售。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Despite Grandpa Keaton's skepticism, Pop did obtain possession of a quarter-section of virgin land and managed to hold onto it long enough to sell it for $1,000.

　　“我用这笔钱去了加州，”他说，“想参加一些演出，但是没有人欣赏我的才华。当时有传言说要挖金矿，但和很多人一样，我去得太晚了。时间一天天过去，我的钱也花光了。当一切快结束时，我回到了俄克拉荷马州，切诺基地带（Cherokee Strip）正在开放。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I used this money to get to California," he said, "with the intention of joining some show. But no one appreciated my talent. There was talk in the air about a gold strike, but like a lot of other people I got there too late. Time passed, and so did my money. When it was almost all gone I headed back to Oklahoma where the Cherokee Strip was being opened up."

　　爸爸骑在烧木头的火车头上，为了安全起见，他紧紧抓住烟囱完成了这次旅行的最后一程。火车头每次用完木头，火车就停下来，爸爸和其他乘客不得不下车收集更多的燃料，然后才能继续前行。当他最终到达目的地时，他只有爷爷那可靠的温彻斯特枪和八美元现金。根据他之前作为先驱者的经验，他知道自己可能会遇到哪些狡猾的顾客和贪婪的恶棍，于是他把8美元中的7美元花在了步枪的子弹上，剩下的1美元用来买培根和豆子。尽管切罗基地带的水费是一美元一夸脱，但其他的都很贵，爸爸还是设法活了下来，并保住了慷慨的政府分配给他的一些土地。爸爸的命运伪装成卡特勒-布莱恩特的10美分医药秀，终于在此刻追上了他。26岁的爸爸看了一眼16岁的妈妈，然后就在那申请了一份工作。

Pop made the last lap of this trip straddling the top of a woodburning locomotive, clinging for safety to the smokestack. The train stopped every time the locomotive ran out of wood. Pop and the other passengers had to get off and gather up more fuel before they could proceed. When he finally approached his destination he had only Grandpa's trusty Winchester and eight dollars in cash. Knowing from his previous experience as a pioneer what slippery customers and greedy varmints he was likely to encounter he spent seven of the eight dollars on bullets for his rifle, using the remaining dollar for bacon and beans. Though they were charging a dollar a quart for water on the Cherokee Strip and everything else was expensive, Pop managed to survive and hold onto some of the land the generous Government had allotted him. Then it was that his destiny, disguised as the Cutler-Bryant 10-cent Medicine Show, caught up with him. Pop who was twenty-six, took one look at Mom, then sixteen, and applied for a job.

　　她的父亲弗兰克·卡特勒（Frank Cutler）是一个典型的在中西部小城镇工作的巡回艺人。我想他从没见过芝加哥，更不用说纽约了。他来自爱荷华州的康瑟尔布拉夫斯。卡特勒爷爷喜欢写诗，后来也喜欢写独幕剧。这些诗句涉及从政治到新奥尔良的苏利文-科比特拳击赛（Sullivan-Corbett fight）的方方面面。当卡特勒爷爷能负担得起的时候，他就把自己写的诗印出来，包在基卡波长生不老药上，这药多年来一直是演出的唯一收入来源。他和他的搭档布莱恩特先生开始收取10美分的入场费，因为他们发现即使是中西部小镇的乡巴佬也不相信免费的娱乐有什么好处。

Her father, Frank Cutler, was a typical traveling showman who worked the small towns in the Midwest. I don't think he ever saw Chicago, to say nothing of New York. He came originally from Council Bluffs, Iowa. Grandpa Cutler liked to write verses, and later on, one-act plays. The verses concerned everything from politics to the Sullivan-Corbett fight at New Orleans. When he could afford it, Grandpa Cutler had his verses printed and wrapped them around the Kickapoo Elixir which for some years had been the show's only source of revenue. He and his partner, Mr. Bryant, started charging ten-cents admission on discovering that even the small-town hicks of the Middle West didn't believe that entertainment was any good when you got it free.

　　老爹曾经给他家乡特雷豪特的报纸写过一封信，描述他进入演艺界的经历，以及他和我母亲的罗曼史。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop once wrote a letter to his home-town paper in Terre Haute describing his entry into show business together with his and my mother's romance.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“我可以谈论节目，”信中解释道，“即使我在舞台上除了几次翻跟头外做不了什么。然而，我得到的报酬是每周3美元，外加食宿和交通费。没有人提到过，但是我很快发现我应该是一个普通跑龙套的，这意味着我将做一切事，包括用木槌打木桩、发传单、张贴两张和四张宣传纸、并听到“嘿，乡巴佬!”，当地的乡巴佬对被骗感到愤愤不平，试图拿戏班出气时的男子呼救。我当时是个健忘的家伙，而且又恋爱了，经常用木槌赶走那些愤愤不平的顾客。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I could talk show shop," the letter explains, "even if I couldn't do much on the stage except for my few flip-flaps. However, I was hired at $3 a week, plus board and transportation. Nobody mentioned it, but I soon found out I was supposed to be a general utility man, which meant I was expected to do everything else, including driving in stakes with a mallet, distributing the handbills, posting up two-sheets and four-sheets, and to come in with fists flying at the cry of 'Hey, Rube!' the carnival man's call for help when the local yokels become resentful at being bilked and try to take it out on the troupe. Being a sort of forgetful chap at the time, and in love besides, I often used my mallet to drive away the indignant customers.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“在成长为一名优秀打手的同时，我还在学习扮演黑人独白、歌曲和真正优秀的古怪舞蹈来增加我的几个翻跟头。我说这很古怪，因为无论是听众，还是在钢琴上陪我的迈拉，都不知道我接下来要走哪条路。我也不知道，因为直到最后一刻我才下定决心。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"While developing into a good rough-and-tumble fighter, I was also learning to augment my few flip-flaps with a blackface monologue, songs, and real good eccentric dancing. I called it eccentric because neither the audience nor Myra, who was accompanying me on the piano, ever knew which way my feet were going next. Neither did I, because I never made up my mind about that until the last possible moment.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“现在，卡特勒先生从来没有否认我靠3美元的食宿和交通费来赚钱的。但他不喜欢我对他女儿献殷勤。他可能一直想要一个每周至少能挣5美元的女婿。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Now Mr. Cutler never denied I was earning my $3 plus board, lodging, and transportation. But he didn't like me paying attentions to his daughter. He may have been holding out for a sonin-law with an earning capacity of at least $5 a week.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“不管怎么说，他每次看到我们牵着手就会解雇我。迈拉和我含泪道别的次数比十几个罗密欧与朱丽叶还要多。但我有一张王牌：我的最低工资。无论怎么找，卡特勒先生也找不到一个像我这样痴情的人，或者像我这样傻到为了这么少的工资而努力工作的人。所以他不断地重新雇用我。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"At any rate, he kept firing me every time he saw us holding hands. Myra and I exchanged more tearful good-bys than a dozen Romeo and Juliet teams. But I had an ace in the hole: my minute wages. Search as he would, Mr. Cutler never could find anyone love-smitten or stupid enough to work as hard as I did for such small wages. So he also kept re-hiring me.
</font></details>

　　“有一天，卡特勒-布莱恩特10美分秀正在播放内布拉斯加州林肯市的音乐，我和迈拉溜到治安法官的家里去结婚。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"One day, when the Cutler-Bryant 10-cent Show was playing Lincoln, Nebraska, Myra and I slipped off to the home of a Justice of the Peace to get married.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“他对证婚词了如指掌。但在我们结为神圣的夫妻后，危机出现了。他告诉我:“先生，需要两美元。”我翻遍了所有的口袋，只找到1.90美元。迈拉只有十七岁，是个不善规划的人，除了一脸困惑的微笑外，没有什么可说的。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"He knew his lines perfectly. But a crisis developed after he had united us in holy matrimony. He told me, 'That will be $2, sir.' After I looked in all my pockets I could produce only $1.90. Myra, being only seventeen and the impractical type, had nothing to contribute except a bewildered smile.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“当我局促不安、大汗淋漓的时候，治安法官咧着嘴笑着说:‘好吧，乔，我和你平分这1.90美元，他用我给他的95美分买了一顿丰盛的婚礼早餐，有火腿、鸡蛋、面包卷和咖啡，我们三个人吃。’”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"While I was squirming and sweating, the Justice of the Peace said with a grin, 'Okay, Joe, 111 split the $1.90 with you/ On the ninety-five cents I gave him he bought a big wedding breakfast, ham and eggs, rolls and coffee, for the three of us."

　　婚礼后，我的父母去为一个医药秀工作，每周工资17美元。爸爸又要打木桩、搭帐篷、发传单，张贴两张和四张传单。他们演了三场演出——他的歌曲、舞蹈和空翻表演，妈妈的萨克斯演奏，然后他们俩一起表演，妈妈在弹钢琴，爸爸做更多的歌曲、舞蹈和空翻表演。爸爸说，有很多次，他不得不带上一根击棍去收集他们的17美元。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After the wedding my parents went to work for a medicine show at seventeen dollars a week. Again Pop had to drive in stakes, put up the tent, pass handbills and post up two-sheets and foursheets. They put on three acts—his song, dance, and flip-flap specialty, Mom's saxophone solos, then both of them together, Mom at the piano and Pop doing more songs, dances, and flip-flaps. Many a time, Pop said, he had to take a club along to collect their seventeen dollars.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　几个月后，爸爸和哈里·胡迪尼成为医药秀的合作伙伴，胡迪尼也刚刚开始他的表演事业。爸爸跳舞，妈妈吹萨克斯，胡迪尼表演几个纸牌戏法，轻松摆脱了当地警长的手铐，让顾客们大吃一惊。多年后，胡迪尼夫人在她的回忆录中写道，当他们一起在舞台上时，魔术师对他的滑稽动作哈哈大笑破坏了这个笑话，爸爸变得多么愤怒。胡迪尼也是一个“医生”，他以一美元一瓶或者五美元六瓶的价格出售了Kickapoo长生不老药，听胡迪尼医生说，从理发师的瘙痒到奔马痨（galloping consumption），一切都很好。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After a few months of this, Pop and Harry Houdini, who was also just making his start in show business, became partners in their own medicine show. Pop did his dances and flip-flaps, Mom played her saxophone solos, and Houdini did a few card tricks and astonished the customers by getting out of the local sheriff's handcuffs with the greatest of ease. In her memoirs, Mrs. Houdini years later told how indignant Pop became when the magician laughed uproariously at his antics, spoiling the joke, while they were on the stage together. Houdini was also the "doctor" who sold Kickapoo Elixir for a dollar a bottle, or six for five dollars. It was good, to hear Dr. Houdini tell it, for everything from the barber's itch to galloping consumption.

　　为了证明这一点，他的一边是基卡波女人，另一边是基卡波勇士。每当他要求他们证实他的说法，即这种神奇药物的秘方是他们的祖先传给他们的时候，他们都赞许地哼了一声，点点头。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
To prove it, he had a Kickapoo squaw on one side of him, a Kickapoo brave on the other. They grunted approvingly and nodded whenever he asked them to confirm his statement that the secret prescription for this marvelous medicine had been passed down to them by their ancestors.

　　大约在我出生前两个月，我母亲出了意外。爸爸架马车送她去他们在爱荷华州一个小镇上的寄宿公寓，但他下车去杂货店买了些东西。那匹马被一道闪电吓了一跳。它以如此之快的速度跑过了拐角，以至于马车翻了两个轮子，把我母亲摔在了地上。当爸爸到她身边时，她抬起头笑着说。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
About two months before I was born my mother was in an accident. Pop was driving her to their boardinghouse in a small Iowa town but got out of the buggy to buy something at the general store. Startled by a flash of lightning, the horse bolted. He raced around the corner at such speed that the carriage went over on two wheels, throwing my mother out on the ground. When Pop reached her side, she looked up and smiled.

My birth, in Pickway, Kansas, on October 4,1895, was comparatively uneventful, though Pickway itself soon afterward was blown away during a cyclone.

　　除了我的出生地被龙卷风从地图上抹掉外，我还得和基卡波土著的小屁孩分享妈妈的奶水，因为她妈妈没有自己的奶水。

　　我六个月大的时候从楼梯上摔下来，哭了起来。胡迪尼就在旁边，他把我抱起来，说:“天哪，真是个Buster！”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When I was six months old, I fell downstairs and burst into tears. Houdini, who was nearby, picked me up, and said, "My, what a Buster!"
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸也在那里，然后决定用这个绰号。据我所知，我是第一个得到这个绰号的人，就连&nbsp;R. F.&nbsp;奥特科特的连载漫画中的人物巴斯特·布朗（Buster Brown）都是在我出生几年后诞生的。每个人，包括我的三个妻子，都叫我巴斯特。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop there and then decided I should be called that. As far as I have been able to learn I was the first man given that nickname. Even Buster Brown, the character in R. F. Outcault's comic strip, was born a few years after I came into the world. Everybody, including each of my three wives, always called me Buster.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　有一次在我十一岁的时候，这个绰号让我有些担忧。“现在叫我巴斯特没关系，”我向妈妈抱怨道，“但当我老了有了孙子孙女，那会是什么感觉呢？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The one time having that nickname worried me was when I was about eleven. "It is all right for me to be called Buster now," I complained to my mother, "but what will it sound like when I'm an old man and have grandchildren?"
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“你说得有道理，”她说，但建议我等到有了孙子辈再为这事操心。(妈妈是对的，现在我有六个孙子孙女，他们都叫我巴斯特爷爷，我很喜欢这个称呼。)
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"You have a point," she said, but suggested I wait till I had my first grandchild before troubling myself too much about it. (Mom was right. I now have six grandchildren who call me Grandpa Buster—and I like it fine.)
</font></details>

　　爸爸妈妈从来都不担心我在舞台上受伤，那可能是因为我们在堪萨斯的某个小镇时，我度过了相当多的时间。那时我还不到三岁，他们也差不多要离开医药表演，投身于歌舞杂耍了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
If neither Mom nor my father ever worried about my getting hurt on the stage it may have been because of a rather full day I put in while we were in some little Kansas town. I was not yet three, so it was just about the time they were quitting the medicine-show business for vaudeville.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在这个特别的早晨，我在我们所住的寄宿公寓的后院遛弯。雇来的女孩正在拧干衣服。拧干机使我着迷，我把食指伸进去，压碎了，于是请来医生把那根手指的第一个关节切了下来。医生把食指包扎好后，我哭着睡着了。当我醒来时，我又一次到后院去冒险。这次我看到了我想要的桃子。但它太高了我够不着。作为一个足智多谋的小家伙，我设法找了一块砖头朝它扔去。我没打中桃子，砖头却落在我头上，砖都劈开了。医生再次被叫来，这次在我的头皮上缝了三针。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
On this particular morning I wandered out into the back yard of the boardinghouse where we were staying. The hired girl was wringing out the clothes. The wringer fascinated me, and I stuck my index finger in it, crushing it, so that the doctor summoned cut off the finger at the first joint. After he bound it up, I cried myself to sleep. When I woke up I once more went adventuring in the back yard. This time I saw a peach I wanted. But it was too high for me to reach. Being a resourceful little chap, I managed to find a brick to throw at it. I missed the peach, but the brick fell on my head, splitting it open. The doctor was summoned again, this time to sew three stitches in my scalp.
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　我被哄上了床，这次我被堪萨斯州的龙卷风声音吵醒。我站起来，走到开着的窗户前，仔细听着嗖嗖作响的声音。我没有从窗户掉下去，而是被旋风盘旋的风吸了出来，沿着公路旋转着吹走了。我在离农舍大约一个街区的地方滚来滚去，这时一个男人看见了我，冲了出来，一把抱起我，把我带到最近的防风地窖里。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Again I was put to bed. This time I was awakened by the noise of a Kansas twister. Getting up I went to the open window to investigate the swishing noise. I didn't fall out of the window, I was sucked out by the circling winds of the cyclone and whirled away down the road. I had rolled and revolved about a block from the farmhouse when a man saw me, rushed out, scooped me up, and carried me to the safety of the nearest storm cellar.

<details><summary>
　　每个人都承认这是相当艰苦的一天，但对我的“人类拖把”的职业生涯来说是个锻炼。在我16年的杂耍生涯中，我只错过了一场演出，因为我们在疯狂而喧闹的表演中受伤了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
A pretty strenuous day, as anyone will admit But superb conditioning for my career as "The Human Mop." In my sixteen years in vaudeville I missed but one performance because of an injury sustained during our wild and rowdy roughhouse act.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　有一次，爸爸把我扔到后面有一堵砖墙的地方。在那之前我们都没有注意到那堵墙。我头上被撞出了一个大肿块，但肿块很快就消掉了，足以让我出席当晚的演出。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Once, it was true, Pop threw me into scenery that had a brick wall right behind it. None of us had noticed the wall until then. I got a big lump on my head from that, but the lump went down quickly enough for me to appear at the evening performance.
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　刚刚提到的我错过的那场演出是在我大概八岁时候，这件事发生在纽黑文的波利剧院，每个演员都盼望着这天演出，因为剧院街对面的酒店里有美味的厚木板牛排。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I was about eight the day I missed the show I mentioned. This happened at Poli's Theatre in New Haven, a date every act looked forward to playing because of the superb plank steaks they served in the hotel across the street from the theatre.

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们刚刚发明了一种让人窒息的套路，从那以后成百上千的喜剧演员一直使用这种套路。我走到一扇门后面，把头伸出来。一只手掐着我的喉咙，这只手似乎要掐死我。爸爸冲过来和看不见的袭击者搏斗，在我头顶上踢他。但当他把我从门后拉出来时，观众才发现是我自己的手掐住了我的喉咙，我仅仅是把胳膊从肘部向后弯曲，就产生了这种错觉。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We had just invented the half-strangling routine which hundreds of comics have been using ever since. In this I went behind a door and stuck out my head. A hand was around my throat and apparently choking me. Pop rushed over to fight my unseen assailant, kicked at him above my head. But when he pulled me from behind the door the audience discovered that it had been my own hand which had been gripping my throat. I'd created the illusion merely by bending my arm back from the elbow.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在日场演出中，爸爸判断错了距离一脚踢中了我的头，直接把我踢昏了。我头朝前倒在地上，砰的一声巨响，但爸爸已经习惯了我用拳头发出很大的声音，所以他一开始并没有意识到发生了什么，当他恍然大悟时，他抱起我，把我从剧院抱到街对面我们在旅馆里的房间里。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
At this matinee Pop misjudged the distance when he kicked, and caught me in the head, knocking me cold. I fell backward, headfirst. There was a loud thump, but Pop was so accustomed to me making loud noises with my fist that he didn't realize at first what had happened. When the truth dawned on him he picked me up and carried me out of the theatre and across the street to our rooms in the hotel.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我昏迷了十八个小时，导致三基顿错过了当晚的演出。医生们一直在对我治疗，直到第二天早上我才苏醒过来。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I was unconscious for eighteen hours, causing The Three Keatons to miss that night's performance. The doctors never stopped working on me until the next morning when they managed to revive me.

　　在对我进行检查后，他们告诉我，我是个幸运的男孩，因为我的颅底没有受伤，头骨也完好无损。他们说，如果我在床上安静地休息几天，我就会完全康复。

After examining me they told me I was a lucky boy because the base of my brain was uninjured and my skull was intact. If I rested quietly in bed for a couple of days, they said, I would be perfectly all right.

　　他们走后，我派人下楼去买吃的，下午一点半我开始穿衣服。妈妈看见我说：“你想去哪儿？”

　　“日场时间到了，是吗？”

　　“你认为你应该……”她开始说。

　　“当然，我感觉很好。”

　　她叹了口气。“好吧，看在迈克的份上，别着急。至少在前几场演出中是这样。”

　　“当然，妈妈，当然。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After they left I sent downstairs for some food, and at 1:30 in the afternoon I started to dress. Mom, on seeing me, said, "Where do you think you re going?"

"It's time for the matinee, isn't it?"

"You think you should. . ." she started to say.

"Sure, I feel all right."

She sighed. "Well, for the love of Mike, take it easy. At least for the first couple of shows."

"Sure, Mom, sure."

　　当爸爸看到我走进更衣室时，他几乎不敢相信自己的眼睛。当我坐下来开始化妆时，我说：“爸爸，我今天不会摔得太厉害。别紧张。”然后我还是逗了他一下。“我不会有事的，只要你今天别再踢我的头。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When Pop saw me walk into our dressing room he could hardly believe his eyes. As I sat down and started putting on my make-up I said, "I just won't take any tough falls today, Pop. I'll just take them easy." And then I thought I might as well tease him a little. "Ill be all right if you just make sure you don't kick me in the head again today."

　　没有任何后遗症。我也很轻松。但让我生气的是，我最终被解雇的几天，是因为剧院外的一场事故。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
There were no aftereffects. But I did take it easy. What got my goat was that when I finally did get knocked off for a few days it was due to an accident outside the theatre.

　　一天晚上，我在芝加哥的莫扎迪斯（Majestic）约会时耽搁了演出，不得不匆忙赶到剧院。当我在黑暗中沿着舞台门口的巷子奔跑时，我踩到了一块钉着生锈钉子的木板。钉子穿过我的鞋，深深地扎进我的脚里。我能把木板扯下来，但钉子没扯下来。莫扎迪斯的道具员不得不用一把钳子把它弄出来。我在伤口上浇了碘酒，然后包扎起来。但是第二天，我的脚还是很痛，我只能一瘸一拐地进行两场演出。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
One night while playing a date at the Majestic, in Chicago, I was delayed and had to rush to the theatre. As I raced down the stage-door alley in the dark I stepped on a board with a rusty nail in it. The nail went through my shoe and deep into my foot. I was able to pull off the board but not the nail. The Majestic's prop man had to use a pair of pliers to get it out. I doused the wound with iodine and bandaged it. But next day the foot was still sore, and I limped through both shows.

Next day we took a train for Milwaukee, our next stop. On the train I ran a high fever. The doctor in Milwaukee, whom we consulted, said I was on the verge of lockjaw. He slit open the wound and put a drain in it; he warned me to keep off my foot for the next few days.

　　他一定猜到我并不想这么做，所以他对我说：“如果你不这样做，那我就不负责了，你仍然有破伤风的危险。”

<details><summary>
　　这使我打消了他一走我就起床的念头，剧院给我们找了个替补，这是三基顿第一次也是最后一次因为生病而停工整整一周。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That caused me to drop the idea of getting up as soon as he left. The theatre got a replacement for us. It was the first and last time The Three Keatons laid off for a whole week because of illness.

</summary><font color=gray><br>
If Pop or I had a sprained ankle we worked despite advice of doctors "to keep off of it for the next few days." All we did was tie it up crisscross with webbed bandage as tight as we could. That hurt a little, but far worse was taking falls with a stiff neck. That was agony.

　　我们工作过的一些舞台地板对我们的表演来说很艰难，因为它们充满了碎片。有一次爸爸从我们表演时用的桌子上摔了下来。一根四英寸长、半英寸宽的厚碎片刺进了他的脑袋。碎片把他那吓人的假发紧紧地别在他头上，以至于无法把假发取下来，我最终帮他拔出来碎片。像往常一样，当他发生这样的事故时，我们用肥皂和水仔细地清洗他的伤口，挤出一些血，并涂上碘酒。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Some of the stage floors we worked on were tough on our act because they were full of splinters. One time Pop fell off the table we used in our act. A thick splinter four inches long and about a half-inch wide was driven into his head. It pinned his fright wig to his head so tightly he couldn't get the wig off. I finally managed to pull it out for him. As usual when he had such accidents we washed out the wound carefully with soap and water, squeezed some blood out of it, and applied iodine.

</summary><font color=gray><br>
Mom also never complained about anything. Pop ran the act's necessary business, and she was supposed to take care of the money. Like every other woman in vaudeville she carried the act's cash in a grouch bag. This was a chamois purse which hung under her dress from a string round her neck.

　　在那之后的前三站，妈妈和那个袋子相处得还不错，这些城市分别是丹佛、盐湖城和温哥华。但是，当我们沿着西海岸出发后不久，那个袋子里装满了价值10美元和20美元的金币，妈妈不得不买了一个金币腰带。原因是我们的演出每周能得到225美元，而我们的开销非常小。我们住过的最好的美式酒店，每人每天的食宿费用只有1.25美元，我们三个人一周的食宿费用是26.25美元。我们所有的其他生活开支，包括小费、爸爸的啤酒和其他普通奢侈品，每周都不超过50美元，而旅行费用平均每周30美元。所以妈妈每周存了将近120美元。当我们回到东部时，她身上已经带着1600美元了。我知道这些10美元和20美元的金币几乎重7磅。当妈妈回到山姆大叔的折叠货币被认定为有效货币的地方时，她可以被描述为真正有钱了。

Mom did all right with the grouch bag during the first three stops we made after that. These were Denver, Salt Lake City, and Vancouver. But soon after we started down the West Coast the grouch bag was so full of ten-dollar and twenty-dollar gold pieces that Mom had to buy a money belt. The reason was that our act was then getting $225 a week with our expenses very small. The best American-plan hotels, where we stopped, charged only $1.25 per day per person for room and board, which came to $26.25 a week for the three of us. All of our other living expenses, including tips, Pop's beer, and other modest luxuries ran no more than fifty dollars a week, and traveling expenses averaged thirty dollars a week. So Mom was stashing away almost $120 a week. By the time we started back East she was carrying about $1,600 on her gold-lined person. I understand that this much money in ten-dollar and twenty-dollar gold pieces weighs almost seven pounds. Mom could be described as truly loaded when she got back where Uncle Sam's folding money was recognized as valid currency.

　　回想起我那激动人心的童年，我必须承认我在成长过程中错过了一件事，那就是普通的学校教育。我是一个如此成功的儿童表演者，以至于没有人问我长大后是否还有其他想做的事情。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Thinking over that exciting childhood of mine, I must admit that one thing I missed while growing up was an ordinary school education. I was so successful as a child performer that it occurred to no one to ask me if there was something else I'd like to do when I grew up.
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　如果有人问我，我会说：“土木工程师。”我想我会是个好土木人。但即使在50年前，你也无法通过一天的学校教育而获得学位。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
If someone had asked me I would have said, "Civil engineer." I imagine I would have been a good one. But even fifty years ago you could not qualify for a degree with a one-day school education.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那是我唯一拥有的：在学校的一天。这是我六岁的时候，我们在泽西城的邦顿剧院演出。在我们开演的前一天晚上，另一位演员问我父亲是否该我去上学。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That's all I ever had: one day in school. This, when I was six years old and we were playing the Bon Ton Theatre in Jersey City. The night before we opened another actor on the bill asked my father if he didn't think it was time I started going to school.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“当然，”爸爸说，但他指出，我几乎每周都得去不同的城市上学。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Of course it is," said Pop, but pointed out that I'd have to attend a school in a different city almost every week.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　另一个演员，一个明显有逃学官血液的人，说校长们会尽一切可能帮助我接受教育。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The other actor, a man who obviously had truant officers blood in his veins, said that school principals would co-operate in every way they could to help me get an education.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“日场呢？”爸爸问。“你知道，我们在一些下午的三点之前上课，那已经时放学的时候了。”他的朋友对此也有答案。他说老师会让我在放学前离开。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"What about matinees?" asked Pop. "As you know we re on some afternoons before three o'clock, and that's when school gets out." His friend also had the answer to that one. He said my teachers would let me leave before school was dismissed.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他说：“你所要做的就是写个便条解释一下情况，这将给巴斯特一个完整的上午在学校，还有半个小时到一个小时的下午课程。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"All you'll have to do is send a note explaining the situation," he said. "This would give Buster a full morning in school and also a half hour to an hour of the afternoon session."
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　第二天早上，爸爸在令人讨厌的8点叫醒了我，催促我去离邦顿最近的公立学校。校长真是太仁慈了。九点十五分的时候，我和其他同龄的小男孩坐在一起，所见所闻令我着迷。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Next morning Pop roused me at the ungodly hour of 8 a.m., to hustle me to the public grammar school closest to the Bon Ton. The principal could not have been more gracious. By nine-fifteen I was at a desk with other little boys my age and fascinated by everything I saw and heard.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　不幸的是，我知道一些我在Avon Comedy Four的学校表演中听到的笑话，所以我决定讲这些笑话给课堂带来欢乐。老师点名：
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Unfortunately, I knew some jokes I'd heard in the Avon Comedy Four's school act and decided to bring joy into the classroom by telling them. The teacher called the roll:
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>

　　“史密斯？”

　　“到！”

　　“约翰逊？”

　　“到！”

　　“基顿？”

　　“我今天没来。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Smith?"

"Here!"

"Johnson?"

"Here!"

"Keaton?"

"I couldn't come today."
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这句话引起了全班一片哗然，甚至赢得了老师赞赏的微笑。上学意味着每天都要上演一场额外的演出，令我着迷的是，我迫不及待地等待着下一个机会，把我的同学们带到走廊里。地理课上，老师问：“什么是岛？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That sent the class into an uproar and even won an appreciative smile from the teacher. Enchanted that going to school meant only putting on an extra show each day, I could hardly wait for the next opportunity to spin my fellow scholars out into the aisles. During our geography lesson our teacher asked: "What is an island?"
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我的手突然举了起来。老师点了点头，我说：“老师，岛就是海洋上的一个疣。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Up shot my hand. When the teacher gave me the nod, I said, "An island, ma'am, is a wart on the ocean."
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　尽管她只是苦笑了一下，但我的同学们还是大笑起来，高兴得尖叫起来，整个房间都震动了。接下来是语法课。其中一个问题是：“给我一个带‘快乐’（delight）这个词的议题？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Though that brought only a wry smile from her, my classmates rocked the room with their guffaws and shrieks of delight. Next came grammar. One of the questions was: "Give me a question with the word delight in it?"
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我的手又一次率先举了起来。我的回答是：“风吹进窗户，吹灭了灯（de light）。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Once again my hand was up first My answer was: "The vind blew in the vindow and blew out de light"
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我知道的下一件事就是老师抓住我的后脖颈，带着我向校长办公室走去。在听到对我不利的证据后，他让我带着一张纸条回家：“不要再送这个男孩来我们学校了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The next thing I knew the teacher was marching me, by the scruff of my neck, down to the principal's office. On hearing the evidence against me, he sent me home with this note: "Do not send this boy to our school any more."
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　从那以后，妈妈开始教我三个“Rs”。我没有接受正规教育，而是从我的职业中获得了任何人都想要的最好的教育。正如我之前提到的，我是一个天生的模仿者，从吞剑到演奏音乐锯，我可以模仿任何事情。我还从著名的老吟游诗人乔治·普里姆罗斯（George Primrose）那里得到了软鞋舞的指导，比尔·罗宾逊（Bill Bojangles Robinson）教我软鞋舞和踢踏舞，赫伯·威廉姆斯（Herb Williams）在演出间隙教我弹钢琴，胡迪尼（Houdini）向我展示了他的一些戏法。那个最伟大的舞台魔术师从来没有告诉过我他真正的秘密;他是如何设法从“不可越狱的牢房”，用结实的绳子绑着的银行保险箱里，或者从紧身衣中逃脱的。他可以倒挂在布鲁克林大桥上，甚至在水下也能做最后一招。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After that Mom attended to the job of teaching me the three ‘Rs’. Instead of formal schooling I did get the best catch-as-catchcan education from my profession anyone could have wanted. As I've mentioned before, I was a natural mimic and could imitate everything from sword-swallowing to playing a musical saw. I also got instruction in soft-shoe dancing from George Primrose, the famous old minstrel man, and Bill (Bojangles) Robinson taught me soft-shoe and tap dancing, Herb Williams gave me piano lessons between shows, and Houdini showed me a few of his sleight-of-hand tricks. That greatest of all stage magicians never told me his real secrets; how he managed to escape from "escape proof prison cells, from bank safes tied with strong ropes, or from strait jackets. He could do this last trick while hanging upside down from Brooklyn Bridge, or even while under water.
</font></details>

　　奇怪的是，我不记得爸爸教过我什么。我只是看着他做了什么，然后做了同样的事。我可以在不受伤的情况下疯狂地摔倒，只是因为我很早就学会了这种技巧，对身体的控制成为了我纯粹的本能。我从未在舞台上摔断过骨头，那是因为我总是避免摔伤我的后脑勺、脊椎底部、肘部或膝盖。骨头就是这样断的。只有当你不像我一样知道哪些肌肉应该绷紧，哪些肌肉应该放松时，你才会受伤。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Oddly enough, I cannot remember Pop teaching me anything. I just watched what he did, then did the same thing. I could take crazy falls without hurting myself simply because I had learned the trick so early in life that body control became pure instinct with me. If I never broke a bone on the stage it is because I always avoided taking the impact of a fall on the back of my head, the base of my spine, on my elbows or my knees. That's how bones are broken. You also bruise only if you do not know as I do which muscles to tighten, which ones to relax.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　有一次，爸爸和Papa Dollar约定，他是德国一个著名杂技团的团长，教我一些翻滚的技巧。那门课程甚至比我在泽西城上学的时间还要短。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Once Pop made an arrangement with Papa Dollar, the head of a famous German acrobatic troupe, to teach me some tumbling tricks. That course of instruction was even more brief than my schooling in Jersey City.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我父亲从来没有听说过，欧洲的表演者鼓励他们的孩子迅速学习套路，每当孩子们不能完美地表演一个把戏时就会被打一记耳光。Papa Dollar有一次用他的大手打了我一巴掌，老爹用勾拳和右上勾拳来阻止他。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
My father had never been told that European performers encourage their youngsters to learn routines rapidly by smacking them good each time they fail to do a trick perfectly. Papa Dollar slapped me once with his huge hand, and Papa Keaton had to be restrained from showering him with hooks and right uppercuts.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“除了基顿家的，没人能打基顿的孩子，”他不停地喊着。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"No one hits Keaton's children but Keaton," he kept yelling.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　然而，一向冲动的爸爸有一次毫不犹豫地把我扔向观众中一个侮辱妈妈的年轻人。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Yet Pop, always the impulsive type, did not hesitate on one occasion to throw me at a young man out in the audience who insulted Mom.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　就在我们预定了纽黑文的波利剧院的那个星期，400名耶鲁学生因为加比·德斯利（Gaby Deslys）——广告上的头条人物——没有出现而被激怒。他们撕毁座位，威胁要私刑处死经理。他们被学校停学了，但他们中的大多数人在接下来的一周来看了演出，可能是为了证明常春藤盟校的学生也能像那么多有教养的卡车司机一样表现得好。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
This happened when we were booked into Poli's Theatre at New Haven the week after four hundred Yale students were enraged because Gaby Deslys, the French charmer who was advertised as the headliner, had not appeared. They tore up the seats and threatened to lynch the manager. They were suspended by the university. But most of them came to catch the show the following week, possibly to prove that Ivy League undergraduates could behave as well as so many well-bred truck drivers.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在我们的第一个表演之后，母亲像往常一样演奏萨克斯独奏。这一天，耶鲁的学生为她的谦虚努力鼓掌，掌声足以震撼整个剧院。妈妈鞠了六次躬之后，爸爸走到舞台灯光前眨眨眼对他们说：“孩子们，不要宠坏她。她现在已经够难对付的了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After our first roughneck routine my mother, as usual, played a saxophone solo. This day the Yale students applauded her modest effort vigorously enough to rock the theatre. After she took about six bows Pop stepped to the footlights and told them with a wink, "Don't spoil her, boys. She's hard enough to handle now."
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　于是，坐在第一排的一个人喊道：“我同意你的看法，朋友。她糟透了！”愤怒的父亲立刻抓起我，精准无误地把我扔向那个年轻人，击中了他的腹部，打断了他的三根肋骨。我的巴掌鞋打在旁边那个耶鲁人的脸上，打断了他的两颗门牙。我没有受伤，这使我和爸爸都感到惊讶。我们都没想到，不管他把我扔到哪里我应该都会受伤。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Whereupon one of the Old Eli cutups, sitting in the first row, yelled, "I agree with you, friend. She stinks!" My infuriated father promptly picked me up and threw me at the young man with unerring accuracy, hitting him in the stomach and breaking three of his ribs. My slap shoes socked the Yale man next to him in the face, breaking two of his front teeth. I was uninjured, which surprised neither Pop nor me. It never occurred to either of us that I could get hurt no matter where he threw me.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　有一次爸爸把我扔进了幕布里，不小心破坏了另一场演出。该轮到赫尔曼夫人了，她是最受欢迎的魔术师之一赫尔曼大帝的遗孀。她在耍一些简单的把戏，表演结束时，几十只白鸽会从舞台的每个角落飞向她。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Once Pop accidentally wrecked another act by tossing me into the backdrop curtain. This was the turn of Madame Herrmann, the widow of Herrmann the Great, one of the most popular magicians. She was working some of his simpler tricks. At the finish of her act she had dozens of white doves flying to her from every corner of the stage.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　轮到我们之后，她就会结束演出。我怀疑赫尔曼夫人从未见过我们的表演。如果她知道，她就不会等到我们开始时才把她的小羽毛朋友们塞进后台的箱子里。顺便说一下，赫尔曼夫人的舞台服装是一件古色古香的带箍裙的殖民地服装。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
She was to close the show right after our turn. I suspect that Madame Herrmann had never seen our act. If she had, she hardly would have waited until we were actually on to start stuffing her little feathered friends into boxes all over the back stage. Madame Herrmann's stage costume, by the way, was a quaint colonial dress with a hoop skirt.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在那个时代，所有的杂耍剧院都有一个帘，像我们这样的演员自己不用带帘子。这上面有当地的广告，而且总是一幅瀑布、湖泊或河流的画。爸爸在我们表演中会用到这个帘子。他会漫步到脚灯前，假装这是一个酒馆的铜脚架，把脚放在脚灯上方弧形金属护板上。我也是这个动作，我们站在那里，都把手肘放在膝盖上，他会问：“你们要喝点什么，苏格兰威士忌吗？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
In those days, all vaudeville theatres had a house drop (or curtain) which was used by acts like ours who carried no drop of their own. On this were local ads and invariably a painting of a waterfall, a lake, or a river. Pop used this toward the end of our act. He would saunter to the footlights and, pretending it was the brass footrail of a saloon, would put his foot on the curved metal guard over the footlights. I would do the same thing. As we stood there, each resting an elbow on a knee, he would ask: "What will you have, scotch?"
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>

　　我摇了摇头。

　　“黑麦？”

　　“不要。”

　　“杜松子酒？”

　　“不！”

　　“水！”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I would shake my head.

"Rye?"

"No."

"Gin?"

"No!"

"What do you want then?"

"Water!"
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他会抓住我的后脖颈，把我转过来，带我走向帘子，同时抱怨道，“你想要的是水吗？”然后他会把我扔进画好的水景画帘子里，当我摔下时，它会给我很大的帮助。当我滑到地板上时，水滴图案的木条有时会卷起来，我会被困在里面。然后，舞台人员会把幕布拉上几英寸，帮我解脱出来。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Grabbing me by the back of the neck he would turn me around and walk me toward the curtain, meanwhile grumbling, "So it is water you want?" Then he would hurl me into the painted water scene. As I hit the curtain, it would give quite a bit. While sliding to the floor, the drop's wooden strip sometimes would flap up, and I would be trapped in it. The stagehands then would pull up the curtain a few inches to help me free myself.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　邦顿剧院星期一的日场演出，一切都照常进行直到我从幕布上滑下来。在靠近底部的地方，我撞到一个我看不见的物体。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That Monday matinee at the Bon Ton everything went off as usual until I was sliding down the curtain. Near the bottom I felt a bump as I hit some object of substantial proportions that I couldn't see.
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　舞台人员拉起了幕布，把我甩到了舞台上。这也使备受尊敬的寡妇赫尔曼，处在她舞台生涯中最暴露的位置。她正弯腰把最后一只鸽子塞进帘子附近的盒子里，结果被我撞翻了。受惊的鸟儿迅速飞出箱子，向四面八方飞去。赫尔曼坐在舞台上，观众们爆发出粗俗的笑声，我环顾四周，看到魔术师夫人的裙箍被甩到头上，露出了巨大的臀部，即使在那个衬垫很好的时代。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The stagehand pulled up the drop dumping me on the stage. This revealed the highly respectable Widow Herrmann in the most exposed position of her stage career. She had been bending over to stuff the last of her doves in a box near the curtain when knocked flat. The startled birds promptly flew out of their boxes going in every direction. Sitting on the stage, as ribald laughter erupted in the audience, I looked around and saw that the lady magician s hoop skirt had been thrown over her head, displaying her bottom which, even by the standards of that well-padded era, was enormous.
