　　在我从事杂耍表演的那些年里，我最喜欢做的事就是在舞台上表演其他演员的滑稽表演。我第一次尝试的表演是胡迪尼（Houdini）脱下紧身衣。那时我大约六岁。我反穿自己的夹克，把袖子拉在一起，把双手藏起来，然后像观众几分钟前看到的那样扭来扭去、做鬼脸。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
During my vaudeville years I never enjoyed anything more than doing burlesques of the other acts on the bill. The first I ever tried was one of Houdini getting out of a strait jacket. I was then about six. I just put on my own jacket backward, held the sleeves together, hiding my hands, then wriggled, writhed, and grimaced as the audience had seen him do a few minutes before. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　顺便说一句，没有人比我更努力地研究胡迪尼的戏法。我一有机会就像老鹰一样盯着他。我在剧院的各个地方研究他的表演，舞台的两侧，管弦乐队里，阳台和走廊的两侧。我甚至爬到高高的吊景区里，这样我就可以在他工作的时候直接看到他。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
No one, by the way, ever worked harder than I did to figure out Houdini's tricks. I watched him like a hawk every chance I got. I studied his act from all parts of the theatre, from both wings of the stage, from the orchestra and both sides of the balcony and gallery. I even climbed high up in the flies so I could look straight down on him as he worked. 
</font></details>

　　我什么也没发现，那个曾经是我父亲的搭档，给我起外号的人什么也没告诉我。他以弄得我和其他人莫名其妙为乐。我记得有一天和他一起去一个小镇的邮局散步。我们在电话上发现了一把大锁。一如既往，无论他是在台上还是在台下，我无时无刻不在关注着他。但他只碰了一下锁就把它弄开了。我还是无法解释他是怎么做到的。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I found out nothing, and the man who once was my fathers partner and had given me my nickname told me nothing. He delighted in baffling me along with everyone else. I recall taking a walk with him one day to a small-town post office. We found a big lock on the telephone there. As always, whether he was off or on the stage, I was watching him every second. But he made a single pass at that lock and had it off. I still can't explain how he did it. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在威廉·林赛·格雷欣 （William Lindsay Gresham）&nbsp;的新书《胡迪尼，穿过墙壁的人》（Houdini，&nbsp;the Man Who Walked Through Walls）&nbsp;出版之前，没有人解释过他从紧身衣、坚固的箱子、银行金库以及“从头到脚都被铐着、绑着、无法逃脱的监狱牢房”逃脱的经历。但是，关于胡迪尼的非凡天赋的谣言四起。据说，他当医生的兄弟教他能随意使肩膀脱位，这样他就能脱下紧身衣。他应该藏了一把打开手铐的钥匙在嘴里。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Until William Lindsay Gresham's recent book, Houdini, the Man Who Walked Through Walls was published, no one ever explained his never-duplicated escapes from strait jackets, strong boxes, bank vaults, and "escape-proof prison cells while handcuffed and tied up from head to foot. But a great many rumors were circulated about Houdini s extraordinary gifts. His brother, a physician, was said to have taught him to dislocate his shoulders at will, enabling him to get out of any strait jacket He was supposed to conceal in his mouth a key that unlocked any handcuffs put on him. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我只知道一件关于胡迪尼的事: 他不是一个柔术演员。他独特的戏法不是简单的拥有灵活的肌肉和骨骼。我只知道这些。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I know just one thing about Houdini: he was not a contortionist His unique trickery was no simple matter of having flexible muscles and bones. But that is all I know about it.

　　在我们的节目中，观众们最喜欢的滑稽表演，似乎是我们为白瑞摩夫妇和其他百老汇明星在他们的杂耍表演中表演的戏剧速写和独幕剧所做的滑稽表演。一个例子是我们表演的《黄夹克》，一个流行的百老汇情节剧的独幕剧版本。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The burlesques of ours that audiences seemed to enjoy most were those we did of the dramatic sketches and one-act plays the Barrymores and other Broadway stars used in their vaudeville appearances. An example is the one we did of The Yellow Jacket, a one-act version of a popular Broadway melodrama. 
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　故事发生在唐人街的一家古玩店。电影开场时，一对年轻的白人夫妇走进来。当店老板看那个白人妇女时，他第一眼就对她产生了淫欲。他让他的一个苦力捅了她丈夫，将她占为己有。当那个可怜的家伙的尸体被拖出时，另一个苦力敲着一个巨大的中国锣，宣布死亡来到了家里。同时，他用中文大声哀号着祈祷。20年后，在同一家古玩店，幕布落下又升起。那个白种女人，现在已是中年，早已听天由命，成为店主的情妇，直到她的生命结束。但当一对年轻夫妇走进来时，她认出妻子是她的女儿，她从女儿还是婴儿时就没见过她了。但她的中国主人也在盯着这位漂亮的年轻顾客，这位情妇知道他在想什么。她杀了他，然后在幕布落下时敲响了中国锣。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The scene was a curio shop in Chinatown. It opened with a young white couple walking in. When the shop's proprietor looked at the white woman it was a case of lust at first sight. He had one of his coolies stab her husband to get her into his power. As the poor chap's body was dragged out of sight another coolie banged a big Chinese gong to announce that death had come to the house. As he did, he loudly wailed a prayer in Chinese. The curtain went down, then rose on the same curio shop twenty years later. The white woman, now middle-aged, has long since become resigned to remaining the shopkeeper s concubine until the end of her days. But when a young couple walks in she recognizes the wife as her daughter whom she hasn't seen since the girl was an infant. But her Chinese master is also staring at the pretty young customer, and the concubine knows what's on his mind. She kills him, then rings the Chinese gong as the curtain comes down.

　　为了我们的滑稽表演，我在桌子下面放了一个水盆，打算在我和爸爸做一段杂乱无章的表演时用它。爸爸唱歌的时候，我把十三、四把短柄扫帚沿着桌子边排好，扫帚把伸出桌子。我站到桌子上，用绳子系着篮球在爸爸头上方回旋，每次放出一点绳子，旋转的篮球就离爸爸越近。他继续唱歌，直到我用篮球打下他的帽子，然后他与篮球的追逐开始了。我还在桌子上，把他逼到靠近背景的角落，把橡皮绳绕在他的脖子上。橡皮绳不停地在旋转，最后篮球打在他的脸上，他筋疲力尽倒下了，倒在了背景中。最后，我跳上了扫帚，扫帚碰到水盆，结果连盆带水都砸向了他。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
For our burlesque of this act I attached a washtub under our table, planning to use it during a rough-and-tumble routine Pop and I had been doing for some time. While he was singing I lined up our thirteen or fourteen short-handled alley brooms along the side of the table, with the handles jutting out over the edge. Getting up on the table, I began whirling the basketball around my head, letting out a bit of the rope at a time. The circling basketball kept coming closer and closer to Pop, who continued to sing, until I took off his hat with the basketball. Then he took it on the run, chased by the basketball. Still on the table I cornered him near the backdrop and coiled the rubber string around his neck. It kept coiling, and at the end the basketball smashed him in the face, and he fell, battered and helpless, into the backdrop. For the finale I jumped on the brooms, so they fell on him in a shower. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当我们在舞台上演出《黄夹克》时，我也跟着跳上舞台，用一把扫帚使劲地敲打着水盆，同时用我模仿得最好的中文叽叽喳喳地说个不停。这个简单的小噱头引得观众哈哈大笑，这也使我们这个小品的节目单预约到尽可能多的演出。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When we were on the bill with The Yellow Jacket, I followed this up by jumping to the stage and banging on the washtub hard with one of the brooms, meanwhile jabbering away in my best imitation Chinese. This simple little stunt got such a laugh that we got ourselves booked on the same bill with the sketch as often as possible. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　没有一个演员比那些被嘲笑的人更喜欢这种滑稽模仿。他们知道这是讨好。因为你不能模仿拙劣的表演，只能模仿好的表演，几乎所有的表演者都知道这一点。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
None of the other actors enjoyed this sort of spoofing more than those in the turn burlesqued. They recognized it for the flattery it was. For you cannot burlesque a bum act, only a good one, and almost all performers realize this. 
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　作为自由自在的小丑，我们很高兴让其他演员看我们表演。但有一次爸爸确实抱怨过。那一周，伟大的俄罗斯戏剧演员阿丽娅 · 纳齐姆莫娃（Alia Nazimova）登上了节目单的头条。星期一，我们试图从舞台边上看到她的表演，但被命令离开。我们被告知：“旁边有人乱转时，纳兹莫娃夫人无法表演。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Being freewheeling clowns we were delighted to have the other acts watch us work. But once Pop did complain about it. This was during a week that Alia Nazimova, the great Russian dramatic actress, was headlining the bill. On Monday we tried to catch her act from the wings but were ordered away. "Madame Nazimova," we were told, "is unable to perform while people are milling about in the wings " 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们走到前面，在那里看到了她。纳兹莫娃后来成为了著名的无声电影明星，她是有着热切目光和强大感染力的女人。你必须尊重她一流的天赋和对工作的专注。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We went out front and saw her from there. Nazimova, who later became a popular silent movie star, was a woman with great burning eyes and possessed great emotional power. You had to respect her first-rate talent and concentration on her work. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们并没有被冒犯，我们知道她们与我们不同，戏剧表演中的人在很大程度上依赖于他们在表演时后台是否保持安静。他们中的一些人甚至把拖鞋放在箱子里，让舞台管理人员在她们演出时换上。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We were not really offended. We knew that unlike ourselves the people in the dramatic acts depended a great deal on everything being quiet backstage while they were on. Some of them even carried slippers in their trunks for the stagehands to wear while their act was on. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　就在我们因为纳兹莫娃的命令从舞台两侧赶出来的一两天后，爸爸追上了她，在所有人中，她在那里看着我们的滑稽表演。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
But a day or two after we were chased from the wings by Nazimova's order Pop caught her, of all people, watching our roughhouse act from there. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他对舞台管理人员喊道：“请让舞台侧面的人离开。要是那里塞满了研究我们的技巧和窥探我们成功秘诀的演员，我们怎么进行表演？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Please clear the wings," he called to a stagehand. "How can we do our work while the wings are cluttered up with other acts studying our technique and the secrets of our success?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸说话的那一刻就后悔了。纳兹莫娃棕色的大眼睛里溢满了泪水，她转过身去。作为一个外国人，她不明白爸爸只是在开玩笑。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop was sorry the moment he said it. Nazimova's huge brown eyes filled with tears, and she turned away. Being a foreigner, she didn't understand that Pop was only kidding. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他对此感到很难过。那天晚上，他拿出他那台老式打字机，发出了这样的邀请：
</summary><font color=gray><br>
He felt terrible about it. And that night he got out his old Blickensderf er typewriter and issued this invitation: 
</font></details>

　　他给纳兹莫娃端了一把莫里斯椅子放在舞台侧面。她来参加我们的“专业日场演出”，坐着莫里斯椅子上，对我们低俗的滑稽动作发笑，然后她深情的棕色眼睛里又充满了泪水。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
He had a Morris chair put in the wings for Nazimova. She came for our "professional matinee," used the Morris chair, and laughed at our low comedy antics until tears again filled her soulful brown eyes.

　　大多数歌舞杂耍的顶级女明星，像男人一样会自嘲。暴躁的诺拉·贝斯就是这些幽默的演员之一。大家都喜欢她的乐观和无限的慷慨，但她的脾气也很暴躁。多年来，她和杰克·诺沃斯 （她的丈夫和搭档）&nbsp;在杂耍歌舞界有着最好的男女表演。但一旦诺拉听说他丈夫对某个年轻的合唱团女孩不只是像父亲一样感兴趣时，她非常愤怒，并把他们的节目单改成:
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Most of the top women stars of vaudeville, like the men, as I said, could laugh at themselves. The tempestuous Nora Bayes was one of these good-humored sports. Everybody loved her for her cheerfulness and boundless generosity. But she had a raging temper as well. For several years she and Jack Norworth, whom she married and teamed up with, had the greatest man-and-woman act in the business. But once Nora became so incensed on hearing he was taking more than a fatherly interest in a certain young chorus girl that she changed their billing to:

　　当然，玛丽·德雷西亚有着非凡的幽默感和志士的斗志。在她成为一名伟大的舞台和银幕明星很久之后，她仍然怨恨她作为一个年轻的百老汇合唱团女孩所得到的微薄报酬。这就像玛丽负责了一场”一个女人“的运动，想为合唱团的女孩们做些什么，她们的工资仍然很低。1918年，她坚持要求刚刚成立的舞台剧演员工会”公平“保护合唱团和其他更重要的演员，并坚持斗争直到她获胜。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Marie Dressier, of course, had a magnificent sense of humor along with the fighting heart of a crusader. Long after she became a great stage and screen star she continued to resent the small pay she'd got as a young Broadway chorus girl. It was just like Marie to undertake a one-woman campaign to do something about the chorus girls who were still underpaid. In 1918 she insisted that Equity, the just-formed stage actors' union, protect the chorines as well as more important performers, and kept fighting until she won.

　　老人们最嘲笑的是装腔作势，他们会挖苦男人和女人。优雅的维也纳歌手弗里茨 · 席夫 （Fritzi Scheff）&nbsp;吃了不少苦头才明白这一点。我们当时在匹兹堡的大剧院，那个星期，在维克托 · 赫伯特的一部轻歌剧在百老汇大获成功之后，弗里茨登上了头条。她把赫伯特的《再吻我一次》 （Kiss Me Again）&nbsp;作为自己的主题曲，在所有的演出中唱这首歌。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Putting on airs was what old-timers most ridiculed. And they would rib the hell out of a woman as well as a man. Fritzi Scheff, the dainty Viennese singer, learned that the hard way. We were at the Grand Theatre, Pittsburgh, the week Fritzi, following a great Broadway triumph in one of Victor Herbert's operettas, was headlining there. She had made Herbert's "Kiss Me Again," her theme song, and she sang it at all performances. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　弗里奇以俄罗斯大公爵夫人的风格旅行。自从莎拉 · 伯恩哈特 （Sarah Bernhardt）最后一次来美国作告别以来，还没有人看到过像她这样的杂耍之旅。如果弗里茨不像伯恩哈特那样每天晚上假装睡在棺材里，那其他的她都做了。这位矮小的夫人带着三十六件行李，带着一个钢琴师、一个司机、一个男仆和两个法国女仆。一个女仆在剧院接待她，另一个在她的酒店套房接待她。在弗里茨到达每个城市的前一周，一位室内装修师重新装修了她的更衣室和酒店套房。她更衣室的装饰特色是华丽的镜子与金叶框架和窗帘，很适合放在凡尔赛宫的闺房里。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Fritzi traveled in the style of a Russian Grand Duchess. Nothing like her vaudeville tour had been seen since Sarah Bernhardt's last farewell visit to the United States. If Fritzi didn't pretend to sleep each night in a coffin as Bernhardt did, she did everything else. This little lady carried thirty-six pieces of luggage with her and an entourage consisting of a pianist, a chauffeur, a footman, and two French maids. One maid served her at the theatre, the other at her hotel suite. A week before Fritzi arrived in each city, an interior decorator redecorated and refurnished her dressing room and hotel suite. Her dressing room's decor featured magnificent mirrors with gold-leaf frames and drapes suitable to one of the fabulous boudoirs at Versailles. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　她乘坐私人火车旅行。与此相连的是一辆平板车，她乘坐的是皮尔斯-阿罗豪华轿车。她只在酒店和剧院之间坐这辆豪华轿车。或者去下一个她预定演出的城市的路程不太远时。去更远的地方，她会坐火车。考虑到当时在崎岖的道路上旅行是什么样子，这并不愚蠢。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
She traveled in a private railway car. Attached to this was a flat car on which her Pierce-Arrow limousine rode. She used the Pierce-Arrow only for travel between her hotel and the theatre. Or when it was only a short jump to the next city where she was booked to play. She made the longer jumps by train. This wasn't stupid considering what travel over our rough roads was like then. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　席夫小姐的化妆间一直有清新的香水味。在她化妆间的门上，舞台管理人员挂上了一个发光的招牌，上面写着“弗里茨”。她还铺了一条红天鹅绒地毯，从更衣室的门一直铺到舞台。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The air in Mile. Scheff's dressing room was kept freshly perfumed with a delicate scent. And over the door of her dressing room a stagehand fastened an illuminated sign, reading "Fritzi." She also had a red velvet carpet laid from the door of her dressing room to the stage. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我很快就有了兴致，在更衣室上方钉了一个雪茄盒。我把字母“B &#8211; U &#8211; S &#8211; T &#8211; E &#8211; R”剪了出来，为了照明，我在盒子里插了一支点燃的小蜡烛，这样光线就会照进来。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I promptly got into the spirit of things by nailing a cigar box over our dressing room. I cut the letters—B-U-S-T-E-R—out of it, and for illumination stuck a small lighted candle in the box so the light would shine through.

　　喜剧演员伯纳德（邦尼）格兰维尔 （Bernard（Bunny） Granville）&nbsp;的“醉酒”表演是在歌舞杂耍中能看到的最出色的，那个星期他和爸爸还有我一起穿演出服。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Bernard (Bunny) Granville, the comedian who did the best "drunk" act ever seen in vaudeville, was dressing with Pop and me that week. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他坚持问到：“我为什么要让自己显得比弗里茨远远不如？&nbsp;我可能没有红地毯，但我有时会有更有用的东西。”他一边说着，拿出一卷厕纸，从更衣室门口卷到了舞台上。几分钟后，剧院经理就到了我们的更衣室。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Why should I let Fritzi put me in the shade?" he demanded. "I might not have red carpet, but I have something that is a lot more useful at times." As he talked Bunny got out a roll of toilet paper and rolled it from our dressing-room door to the stage. Within minutes the house manager was in our dressing room. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他说：“小伙子们！&nbsp;你们想让我为难吗？&nbsp;如果她发现了这件事会大发脾气离开的，到时候我怎么办？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Fellers!" he said. "What are you trying to do to me? If she finds out about any of this shell throw a fit I think shell walk out. Then where will I be?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　为了避免他心脏病发作，我们取下了雪茄盒招牌，收起了厕纸。但是，当我们第二天继续等待演出时，我们听说有一个舞台管理人员修好了弗里奇的马车。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
To avoid his having a heart attack, we took down the cigar-box sign and picked up the toilet paper. But as we waited to go on next day we heard that one of the stagehands had fixed Fritzi's wagon. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们所有人被告知：“就站在舞台侧面看弗里茨今天的第一场演出，看看她的表现。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
All of us were told, "Just stand in the wings and catch Fritzi's first show today and watch how she behaves." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　弗里茨像往常一样，挥舞着一把小扇子走了进来。她倚在大钢琴上唱了开场曲，小扇子倚在她的臀部。当她唱出前几个音符时，她似乎在扭动着身体。她那使观众着迷的微笑，有一半是苦笑。她继续表演，事情变得更糟了。她一次又一次地转身离开观众，用扇子到处挠她紧身褡束。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Fritzi made her usual entrance waving a little fan. Leaning against the grand piano she sang her opening number, with the little fan resting against her hip. As she sang the first few notes she seemed to be twisting and squirming. The smile with which she bewitched audiences was half grimace. And whatever was troubling her got worse as she continued. Again and again she twisted away from the audience to scratch her tightly-corseted side with the fan here, there, and everywhere. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们都非常喜欢这个奇怪的表演。如果我们知道是什么让威严的小弗里茨·席夫扭动、转身和抓挠，我们可能会更喜欢。那天早上，一个舞台管理人员溜进了她的化妆室，在那个优雅的房间里她坐的地方，轻轻地撒了些发痒的粉末。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
All of us immensely enjoyed this weird performance. We might have enjoyed it even more if we had known what was making majestic little Fritzi Scheff twist, turn, squirm, wriggle, and scratch. That morning a stagehand had sneaked into her dressing room and sprinkled itching powder lightly everywhere in that elegant room that the great woman could possibly sit down. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　偶尔有一些后台玩笑发生失控。 这发生在一个年轻的英国独角戏演员身上，他在纽约的普罗克多的第二十三街剧院进行了他在美国的首次演出。他和爸爸，我，还有一个世纪之交很受欢迎的吟游诗人普雷斯·埃尔德里奇共用一间化妆间。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Occasionally a little backstage joke got out of control This happened to a young English monologuist who was making his American debut at Proctor's Twenty-third Street Theatre, in New York. He was sharing a dressing room with Pop, me, and a popular turn-of-the-century minstrel man named Press Eldridge. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在周一的日场演出前，普雷斯对那个英国人说：“你知道，你们英国人的很多表达方式美国人就是不理解。你为什么不现在和我一起把你的剧本过一遍，这样我们就可以看看你是否应该修改一些你可能使用的东西？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Before the Monday matinee, Press told the Englishman, "You know, there are a great many of your British expressions that Americans just do not understand. Why don't you go over your material with me right now so we can see if you should change anything you may be using?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　独角戏演员非常感激。普雷斯、爸爸和我都严肃地听着，在他讲述他的主要部分之前，我们没有作任何评论。在这首歌中，他穿着新娘的婚纱，唱起了《在教堂等候》。这首歌后来被格雷西 · 菲尔兹演绎得非常好。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The monologuist was most grateful. Press, Pop, and I listened gravely, making no comment until he described his main bit. In this, dressed in a bride's wedding outfit, he sang "Waiting at the Church!" the song later rendered so effectively by Gracie Fields. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当那个英国人唱到关键的最后一句：“当我发现他丢下我不管的时候，上帝啊！（Lord!）这真让我心烦意乱！”普雷斯举起了手。“我很高兴你跟我讨论了这件事，我的好伙伴。美国观众就是不喜欢‘上帝’这个词，我也不知道为什么，但你必须用另一个词。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When the Englishman sang the tag line, "When I found he left me in the lurch, Lord! how it did upset me!" Press held up his hand. "I'm glad you went over this with me, my good fellow. American audiences just do not like the word 'Lord' I don't know why exactly, but you must use another word there." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“可是你有什么建议呢？”英国人问。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"But what would you suggest?" asked the Englishman. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“基督啊！”（Christ!）
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Christ!" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这个吃惊的英国人望着爸爸，想要证实一下，爸爸明智地点了点头。我们谁也没有想到这个英国人会接受埃尔德里奇的建议，因为当时在全美国的剧院里，连“该死”这样的词都是禁忌。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The surprised Englishman looked at Pop for confirmation which Pop gave him with a sage nod. None of us dreamed for a moment that the Englishman would take Eldridge's advice as even the word "damn" was taboo then in theatres all over America. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们从舞台侧面看着那个年轻的英国人。当他说：“基督啊！&nbsp;这真让我心烦意乱！”剧院里有一种令人毛骨悚然的死寂。接下来大家知道的事情是灯光熄灭了，不幸的英国人被偷偷带离舞台，管弦乐队正在演奏下一幕的开场曲。与此同时，普雷斯·埃尔德里奇冲向大街。当我们回到更衣室时，这位可怜的英国人还穿着新娘的服装，试图向愤怒、满脸通红的剧院经理解释他是如何碰巧说出了那个令人震惊的话。他说：“和我一起穿衣服的一个男人告诉我，要把‘上帝’说成‘基督啊’。”剧院经理问：“是哪个人？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We watched the young Englishman from the wings. And when he came out with the line "Christ! how it did upset me!" there was one of those blood-chilling dead silences in the theatre. Next thing anyone knew the lights went out, the unfortunate Englishman was smuggled off the stage, and the orchestra was playing the next act's introductory number. Meanwhile, Press Eldridge had streaked for the street. When we went back to the dressing room, the poor Englishman was still in his bride's costume, trying to explain to the irate and red-faced house manager how he had happened to utter the shocking word. "One of the men I dressed with told me to say it instead of 'Lord.'" he said. The house manager demanded, "Which man was it?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那英国人摇摇头，用含糊的声音回答说：“我不记得了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The Englishman shook his head, and replied in a broken voice, "I can't remember." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们也不记得。当埃尔德里奇回到更衣室时，他也不记得了。我再也没有见到过那个不幸的英国演员，也没有听到过他的消息。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Neither could we. Nor could Press Eldridge when he returned to the dressing room. I never saw nor heard of that unlucky English actor again. 
</font></details>

<br>

　　爸爸相信，当“三基顿”在1911年夏天入侵他的祖国时，无论我们和普雷斯对他做了什么伤害，他都会得到偿还。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop believed that whatever harm Press and we had done him was more than repaid when The Three Keatons invaded the 'alls of the man s native land in the summer of 1911. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸经常说：“我一直以为我会喜欢伦敦古雅的魅力，直到我去那里的那一刻。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I always thought I would enjoy the quaint charm of London," Pop often said, "right up until the very moment I went over there." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　虽然我们在伦敦呆的时间很短，但爸爸后来总是花上几个小时讲述我们在那里遭遇的不幸。他的英国恐惧症变得如此严重，以至于他甚至不愿提及他最好的朋友之一沃尔特 · C · 凯利 （Walter C. Kelly）&nbsp;说服他去那里的事。爸爸似乎觉得这对任何人来说都是一个可怕的指责，包括杂耍界著名的“弗吉尼亚法官”。爸爸希望人们认为杰出的伦敦皇宫剧院经理阿尔弗雷德 · 巴特把我们吸引到了那里。但实际是凯利建议巴特报价让我们去的。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Though our stay in London was brief, Pop ever afterward would spend whole hours relating the misfortunes that befell us there. His Anglophobia became so complete that he didn't even like to mention that one of his very best pals, Walter C. Kelly, had talked him into going there. Pop seemed to feel it was a terrible charge to make against anyone, no less vaudeville's famous "Virginia Judge." Pop preferred people to think that Alfred Butt, the distinguished manager of the Palace in London had enticed us there. But it was Kelly who suggested to Butt that he make us an offer.

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在我们回家后，爸爸给戏剧周刊《综艺》写了一封长信，描述了美国艺术家在伦敦可能面临的羞辱和愤怒。我认为他的信比《权利法案》、《独立宣言》和林肯的葛底斯堡演说加起来还要长。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
On our return home Pop described in a long letter to Variety, the theatrical weekly, the humiliations and exasperations American artists could anticipate in London. His letter is longer, I think, than the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address combined. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们的不幸开始了，爸爸在这份文件中透露，他犯了一个令人痛苦的错误，为他的家人买了四张船票，而不是三张。在他为金格斯和露易丝付了一半路费后，他才知道他们可以免费旅行。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Our misfortunes started, Pop revealed in this document, when he made the distressing mistake of buying four steamship tickets for his family instead of three. It was only after he had paid half fare for Jingles and Louise that he learned that they could have traveled free. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸没能把钱要回来，他说他冲回家，宣布旅行取消了，但当我和妈妈都哭了的时候他改变了主意。尽管如此，他还是做了最后一次绝望的尝试，想要摆脱这次冒险。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Unable to get his money back, Pop said he rushed home and announced that the trip was off, but changed his mind when both Mom and I burst into tears. Nevertheless he made one last desperate attempt to get out of the adventure. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他在信中继续说：“当我们上了船，我开始小题大做，什么都可以扔掉。我甚至拍卖了露易丝。我跳上一个箱子喊道：‘在开船之前，我被授权卖掉这个两岁的孤儿。’竞价开得很好，我把孩子卖给了一个看起来很活泼的小男孩。但当我向他要钱时，他的父亲告诉我只是在开玩笑。一位军官不但没有把我们赶下船，反而对我说，如果我再拍卖我的孩子，他们就把我铐上镣铐。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I started a fuss when we got on board," his letter continued, "anything to be thrown off. I even auctioned off Louise. Jumping on a box, I yelled, ^Before the ship sails I am authorized to sell this two-year-old orphan child.' The bids opened well, and I sold the baby to a bright-looking little boy. But when I demanded cash his father told the youngster I was only fooling. Instead of us being put off the ship, one of the officers told me that if I tried to auction off any more of my children they would put me in irons."

　　凯利认为”三基顿“会在伦敦大获成功，这是合乎逻辑的，因为他自己在伦敦、各省以及像约翰内斯堡和香港这样遥远的英国前哨地区都很受欢迎。他的幽默就像棒球或乔治·M·科汉 （George M. Cohan）&nbsp;的俚语一样，是典型的美国幽默。然而，各地的英国人都嘲笑他的经典笑话，比如关于黑人洗衣女工曼迪 （Mandy）&nbsp;的笑话，曼迪来到他想象中的法庭要求离婚。对话是这样的:
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Kelly's idea that The Three Keatons would be highly successful in London was logical enough, being based on his own popularity there, in the provinces, and such far-flung British outposts as Johannesburg and Hong Kong. For his humor was as typically American as baseball or George M. Cohan's slang. Yet Britishers everywhere laughed at such classic jokes of his as the one about Mandy, the Negro laundress who came to his imaginary court for a divorce. It went like this: 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>

　　“他打你了吗，曼迪？”

　　“没有。”

　　“他赚钱养活你吗？”

　　“是的，先生，他每周六晚上带回家1.75美元的工资。”

　　“那么，曼迪，你为什么要和他离婚呢？”

　　“我想，法官大人，我对他没兴趣了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Does he beat you, Mandy?" <br>
"No." <br>
"Does he support you?" <br>
"Yes, sir, he brings home his $1.75 wages every Saturday night." <br>
"Well, then, Mandy, why do you want to divorce him?" <br>
"I guess, your honor, I just lost my taste for him." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　好心的凯利在伦敦接了我们的火车，为我们找到了寄宿处。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Kelly, a kindhearted man, met our boat train in London. He had already obtained accommodations in a boardinghouse for us. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸没有英国钱，所以凯利给了他一把硬币作为小费，并写下了我们寄宿公寓的地址。他说：“你去拿你的行李，我会把迈拉和孩子们带到你的房间，他们看起来很累了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop had no English money so Kelly gave him a handful of coins for tips and wrote down the address of our boardinghouse. "You get your luggage," he said, "and 111 take Myra and the kids to your rooms. They look tired." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“没人给我认领牌，我怎么拿行李呢？”爸爸说。凯利解释伦敦没有认领牌。爸爸只需要走过去指出他的箱子和我们演出时用的桌子，那是爸爸坚持要带来的。凯利没有说清除维多利亚车站没有搬运工，所以在送我们走之后，爸爸不得不对付一群白教堂威利斯、兰贝斯·路易丝和其他看起来像睡在河堤上的人。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"How do I get my baggage when nobody gave me any claim checks," said Pop. Kelly explained that claim checks weren't used in London. Pop need only go and point out his trunks and the table we used in our act which Pop had insisted on bringing along. Kelly didn't explain that there were no redcaps at Victoria Station. So after seeing us off, Pop had to cope with a mob of Whitechapel Willies, Lambeth Louies, and other men who looked as though they had been sleeping on the Embankment. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　虽然爸爸听不懂这些家伙的伦敦腔，但还是选出了六个人。他们为爸爸找了一辆马车，扶他上了车，然后把我们所有的行李和桌子都堆在他两边和上面，接受了爸爸给他们的小费。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Though unable to understand these chappies' Cockney, Pop selected a half dozen of them. They found a one-horse cab for him, helped him into it, then piled all of our luggage and the table on both sides and on top of him, accepted the tips he gave them. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在去目的地的路上，爸爸从后窗向后看，看到那些帮助他的人跟在马车后面小跑。他以为自己被跟踪了，便叫车夫用鞭子抽打那匹马加快速度。不幸的是，司机十分乐意地听从了，以至于那辆超重的马车用两个轮子驶过了下一个弯，侧翻了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
On the way there, Pop looked back through the rear window and saw the men who had helped him trotting after the cab. Believing himself pursued he asked the cabbie to whip up the horse. Unfortunately, the driver obeyed with such alacrity that the topheavy cab took the next corner on two wheels, toppling over on its side. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸从一片狼藉中爬起来，紧张地对车夫说：“我们快走。那些人还在追我们。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
As Pop unscrambled himself from the debris, he said to the driver nervously, "Let's get going. Those men are still chasing us." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　车夫说：“太好了！他们能帮我们把马车修好。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Good show!" said the driver. "They'll be able to help us right the rig here." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“我不认为这是他们追我们的原因，也许我做错了什么，也许我说了什么冒犯他们的话。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I don't think that's why they are chasing us. Maybe I did something wrong. Maybe I said something that offended them.'' 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　车夫说：“不见得，先生。如果你不介意我这么说的话，我想你给他们的小费一定是太多了。”当爸爸辩解说不懂英国钱时，那人说：“等我们到了你的公寓，先生，我会告诉你给多少小费合适。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Not likely, sir," said the cabbie. "If you don't mind me saying so, I think you must have tipped them most liberally." When Pop pleaded ignorance of British currency, the man said, "When we arrive at your boardinghouse, sir, I will instruct you concerning what constitutes a fair tip." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这六个人追上了他们，高高兴兴地扶着马车，把马扶了起来。他们把行李和桌子重新摆放在爸爸的周围和上面。马车又行驶了，他们跟在后面小跑着。到了寄宿处，他们帮我们把东西卸下来，把行李和桌子搬到三楼我们的住处。从司机那里得到小费提示后，爸爸又慷慨地发了一些小费，并带着所有人去最近的酒吧喝了一通酒。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The six men caught up with them and cheerfully helped right the cab and get the horse back on his hoofs. They rearranged the luggage and the table around and on top of Pop. The cab started off again, with them trotting after it. At the boardinghouse they helped unload the cab and carry the luggage and table up to our lodgings on the third floor. After obtaining the tipping instructions from the driver, Pop distributed some more largesse and took all hands to the nearest pub for a round of drinks. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们很高兴”弗吉尼亚法官“为我们找到了一个家庭式的公寓。我们都很早就上床睡觉了，早上吃的是传统的伦敦寄宿公寓的早餐，有粥、腌熏鲱鱼、煮鸡蛋、松饼和茶。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We were delighted with the family-type boardinghouse the Virginia Judge had found for us. We all went to bed early and in the morning were served with a regular London boardinghouse breakfast, consisting of porridge, bloaters, boiled eggs, muffins, and tea. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　凯利住在莱斯特广场的女王酒店，就在我们家附近。那天晚上，他带爸爸去了伦敦的一家戏剧俱乐部。早晨一点钟，爸爸走上楼梯，看见水手们从各个房间里出来，正在扣外套的扣子。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Kelly was living at the Queen's Hotel on Leicester Square just around the corner from us. That evening he took Pop to a theatrical club in London. Coming up the stairs at one o'clock in the morning, Pop observed sailors coming out of various rooms, buttoning up their coats. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他急忙跑到我们的房间，叫醒我们，坚持让我们不要等天亮就走。他低声对妈妈说：“我们的房子名声不好。”不到一个小时，我们就被安置在了凯利下榻的女王酒店。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
He hurried to our rooms, woke us up, and insisted we move without waiting for morning. He whispered, to Mom "We are in a house of ill fame" and within an hour we were installed in the Queen's Hotel where Kelly was staying. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当时，伦敦的皇宫剧院是世界上最优雅的歌舞杂技剧院，也是唯一拥有皇家包厢的剧院。它占据了整个街区，正厅里必须穿礼服，楼厅里必须穿燕尾服。老爹第一次来的时候，他发现“三基顿”甚至没有出现在宣布下一周看点的海报上。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
At the time the Palace Theatre in London was the world's most elegant vaudeville house and the only one with a royal box. It occupied a whole block, full dress was obligatory in the stalls, tuxedos in the balcony. On Pop's first visit he found that The Three Keatons weren't even billed on the posters that announced the following week's attractions. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸的下一个不愉快的意外是当我们去剧院和管弦乐队一起排练我们表演的音乐时，他有自己独特的管弦乐安排。提供这些音乐的纽约音乐出版商弗雷德·赫夫 （Fred Heff）&nbsp;告诉爸爸，把这些谱子交给皇宫剧院的管弦乐队指挥芬克 （Fink）&nbsp;，并且要非常恭敬地对待他。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop's next unpleasant surprise came when we went to the theatre to rehearse our act's music with the orchestra. He had brought special orchestral arrangements with him. Fred Heff, the New York music publisher who supplied these, had told him to give these to Fink, the Palace's orchestra leader, and to be very deferential about it. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这位深思熟虑的音乐出版商甚至连爸爸的客套话都编排了。是这样的：“这是芬克先生吗？&nbsp;请允许我代表纽约市的美国音乐出版商弗雷德·赫夫先生，向您献上这组编曲，以示他的敬意。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The thoughtful music publisher had even rehearsed Pop in the polite speech he made. This went: "Is this Mr. Fink? Allow me on behalf of Mr. Fred Heff, the American music publisher of New York City, to offer you this set of orchestrations with his compliments." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　无情的芬克先生问道：“这和表演有什么关系？&nbsp;我们继续吧，伙计。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"What has this to do with the act?" demanded the unfeeling Mr. Fink. "Let's get on with it, man." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　排练的第一支曲子进行得很顺利。但当妈妈拿出她的萨克斯风时，整个管弦乐队都开始抱怨起来。一个笛子手喊道：“搞什么鬼！&nbsp;她要演奏那个吗？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
saxophone the whole orchestra pit started grumbling. "What the blooming hell!" exclaimed one flute player. "Is she going to play that?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他旁边的长号手抱怨道：“从没听说过用萨克斯可以很合调。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The trombonist next to him moaned, "Never heard one that was in tune." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我保持警惕，以防爸爸抓住我，把我扔向那些吹毛求疵的音乐家，但他克制住了自己。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I got on guard in case Pop grabbed me and threw me at the carping musicians, but he restrained himself. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　宫廷剧院只有周三和周六有日场，这意味着我们在周一晚上开幕。到了剧院，爸爸沮丧地发现排着长队等着的人们坐在露营椅上，街上有卖艺人在为他们表演，包括一个变戏法的人，三个杂技演员，他们带着自己的地毯，还有一个歌手和吉他伴奏。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
There were matinees only on Wednesday and Saturday at the Palace, which meant we opened on Monday night. Arriving at the theatre, Pop was depressed to find the long line of waiting people, seated on camp chairs, being entertained on the street by buskers, including a juggler, a troupe of three acrobats, who carried their own rug to work on, and a singer with a guitar accompanist. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸咕哝道：“他们为什么要去里面付钱呢？”从第一次演出开始，我们就受到了阻碍，因为舞台地板弯曲，到处都是碎片。爸爸不能把我当人形拖把用，但他像往常一样开心地把我扔到布景里，然后从舞台侧面扔出去。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Why should they go inside where they have to pay?^ grumbled Pop. From the first performance we were handicapped because the stage floor was warped and full of splinters. Pop couldn't use me as a human mop, but he had his usual fun throwing me into the scenery and out through the wings. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在顶层楼座上，我们确实听到了一些人的窃窃私语，但正厅前排、包厢和楼座上却鸦然无声。就连爸爸最好的台词也没有什么效果。当我狠狠地打他时，他说：“他有自己的想法。”后来，当他把我扔到后面的幕布里时，他告诉观众：“应该教孩子尊重父母。”甚至，爸爸在一阵喧闹之后绝望地说：“这句话翻译完不那么好笑了，不是吗？”迎接他的是同样令人毛骨悚然的沉默。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We did get a few titters from the gallery, but the stalls, the boxes, and balcony greeted us with absolute silence. Even Pop's best lines fell flat. When I swatted him violently he said, "He has a mind." Later when he threw me into the back curtain, he told the audience, "Children should be taught to respect their parents." Even when Pop, in desperation, said after a bit of hurly-burly, "It loses a bit in the translation, doesn't it?" he was greeted by the same blood-chilling silence. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当我们离开的时候，凯利和布兰奇·林 （Blanche Ring）&nbsp;，他们也在节目单上，建议爸爸减少这种危险的动作。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When we came off, Kelly and Blanche Ring, who were also on the bill, both advised Pop to tone down on the rough routines. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　凯利说：“你真的吓到观众了，他们认为你在伤害巴斯特，这种行为对他们来说太残忍了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"You actually scared the audience," Kelly said. "They think you are hurting Buster. The act is too brutal for them." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　第二天，艾尔弗雷德·布特也对他说了同样的话，要减少“危险动作”。老爹离开时，布特说：“你在表演时用的不会是你收养的男孩吧？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Next day Alfred Butt told him the same thing, to tone down the "brutality." As Pop was leaving, Butt said, "Isn't that an adopted boy you use in your act?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸喊道：“谁，&nbsp;巴斯特？&nbsp;当然不是。他是我的亲儿子。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Who, Buster?" exclaimed Pop. "Of course not. He's my son." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　布特说：“从你把他扔来扔去的样子来看，我想他一定是被收养的，你一点也不在乎他。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Judging by the way you threw him around," said Butt, "I thought he must be adopted and that you didn't give one damn about him." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸直接从布特的办公室走了出来，为我们订了下周三回家的票。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop went straight from Butt's office and booked passage home for us on the following Wednesday. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　与此同时，我们在每次演出中继续减少我们的危险动作，到周三和周四，我们进展顺利。到了周五和周六，我们表现很棒。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Meanwhile, we continued to ease up on our roughhouse routines at each performance, and by Wednesday and Thursday we were going good. By Friday and Saturday we were doing great. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　一周快结束时，阿尔弗雷德· 布特祝贺爸爸我们现在受到的欢迎，说：“现在你完全可以在各省得到四十周的直接预订，&nbsp;当你完成巡演后，&nbsp;你又可以为我在伦敦表演了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Toward the end of the week Alfred Butt congratulated Pop on the reception we were now getting and said, "Now you will have no trouble at all in getting forty weeks of straight booking in the provinces, and when you are finished that tour, you can play here in London for me again." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　但是爸爸已经决定离开了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
But Pop had made up his mind to leave. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸从不承认英国人有幽默感。他在那里酒吧的经历恶化了他对整个英国的反感。他甚至拒绝对一个英国人对美国独角戏演员马歇尔·P·怀尔德 （Marshall P. Wilder）&nbsp;的评论发笑，怀尔德是一位面容与猴子相似的侏儒。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop never would admit the British had a sense of humor. His experiences in the pubs there had poisoned his mind against the entire United Kingdom. He even refused to laugh at what an Englishman had said about the American monologuist, Marshall P. Wilder, who was a dwarf whose face was not unlike a monkey's. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在我们到达的那一周，彼得大帝，我在舞台上见过的最聪明的黑猩猩，正是皇宫剧院节目单的头牌。当它脱下帽子、外套和手套，在餐桌上用刀叉和餐巾吃饭，滑旱冰，骑自行车，然后脱下剩下的衣服上床睡觉时，他看起来几乎和人类一样。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The week we arrived, Peter the Great, the smartest chimpanzee I ever saw on a stage, was headlining the bill at the Palace. He seemed almost human as he took off his hat, coat, and gloves, ate at a table with a knife and fork and napkin, roller-skated, rode a bicycle, then took off the rest of his clothes and went to bed. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　接下来的一个星期，怀尔德来到了皇宫剧院。伦敦人有了去杂耍剧院再看一场自己喜欢的表演的习惯，而那个星期剧院里有一个特别的赞助人似乎不知道彼得大帝已经结束了他规定的表演。不管怎样，在怀尔德的表演进行到一半时，一个英国人迅速地看了一眼，叹息道，“我的上帝！&nbsp;现在他们都能让它说话了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Wilder came into the Palace the following week. Londoners then had the habit of dropping in at vaudeville houses just to see again a favorite act, and one particular Palace patron that week seemed not to have known that Peter the Great had concluded his engagement. In any event, one Englishman, arriving in the middle of Wilders act, took a quick look and groaned, "My God! Now they have him talking." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这个故事很快传遍了全世界，并一度威胁到怀尔德的杂耍生涯。无论他走在舞台上的什么地方，前面总有人大声说：“我的上帝！&nbsp;现在他们都能让它说话了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That story quickly went around the world and for a time threatened Wilders career in vaudeville. Wherever he walked on a stage somebody out front was sure to say quite audibly, "My God! Now they have him talking." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　但是最让爸爸苦恼的还是吃喝问题。没有人向他透露说酒吧里有女招待。他在伦敦花了半个晚上四处游荡，希望能在酒吧里找到一个男人。爸爸喜欢讲一些低俗的故事，就像他喜欢喝啤酒一样。但在女人面前，他却无法说出这些话。除了不能尽情享受他最喜欢的室内活动之外，他还不能喝到酒吧里供应的温啤酒。他点了麦芽啤酒，但发现温度一样，就放弃了。虽然当时他只喝啤酒，但他在绝望中点了一杯曼哈顿鸡尾酒。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
But it was the eating and drinking situation that most distressed Pop. No one had tipped him off that there were barmaids in the pubs. He spent half of one night in London wandering around from place to place in hope of discovering a man behind a bar. Pop liked telling slightly off-color stories almost as much as he liked beer. But he was incapable of telling one of these before a woman. On top of the deprivation of being unable to indulge in his favorite indoor sport Pop could not drink the warm beer they served in the pubs. He ordered ale but gave that up on finding it the same temperature. Though at the time he drank nothing stronger than beer he ordered a Manhattan cocktail in sheer desperation. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那时候，在伦敦还没有鸡尾酒，酒吧女侍不想被人开玩笑，她说：“哦，对了，快给我们讲讲你们的摩天大楼吧？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Cocktails were then unknown in London, and the barmaid, determined not to be kidded, said, "Oh yes, and do tell us about your skyscrapers?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他也不能忍受乏味的英国食物。“他们连调味都不加。”他不停地叹息。他的整个态度就像一个人发现自己被青铜时代的野蛮人包围着。但我和妈妈都很喜欢，劝他留下来。妈妈提出，一旦我们树立起自己的看点，如果我们不愿意接受美国经理试图强加给我们的薪水或工作条件，我们总可以回来。 这将是我们的杀手锏。但是爸爸不听。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
He also could not endure the uninteresting English food. "They do not even season it," he kept groaning. His whole attitude was that of a man who was discovering himself surrounded by Bronze Age savages. But Mom and I liked it fine, urged him to stay on. Mom pointed out that if we once established ourselves as an attraction we could always return if we did not care to accept the salary or working conditions American managers tried to impose on us. It would be our ace in the hole. But Pop would not listen. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我那已经二十多年没有家的父亲说：“我想家了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I'm homesick," said my Pop who had had no home for over twenty years. 
</font></details>
