<details><summary>
　　老爹在给《综艺》杂志的长信中并没有提到当初带家人去英国的原因。就在不久前，由于不知疲倦的格里协会，我们被禁止在纽约剧院演出两年。讽刺的是，我们最终还是被那些社会善人们抓住了，因为我们为一家慈善机构举办了一场义演。曼哈顿大歌剧院的经理要求爸爸在基顿家五口人都在场的情况下演出。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop did not mention in his long letter to Variety one of the reasons for taking the family to England in the first place. A short while before, thanks to the indefatigable Gerry Society, we had been barred for two years from playing the New York theatres. The irony of this was that the do-gooders got us in the end, because we'd played a benefit show for a charity. The manager of the Grand Opera House in Manhattan had asked Pop to put on the act with all five Keatons appearing. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸同意了，条件是经理保证我们不会被格里协会找任何麻烦。经理给了保证，但我们还是收到了传票。爸爸仍然相信经理的话，当他在法庭上解释经理承诺承担责任时，爸爸甚至没有带律师。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop agreed on condition that the manager guaranteed that we would have no trouble with the Gerry Society. The manager gave the guarantee, but we were served with a summons just the same. Still counting on the manager's word, Pop did not even bother to bring a lawyer with him when he appeared in court and explained about the manager promising to assume responsibility. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　然而，经理出卖了他，站在证人席上否认他曾对爸爸做过任何这样的承诺。我们被罚款250美元，基顿三兄弟被禁止登上纽约舞台。这项禁令持续了两年，对我们的表演来说是一个残酷的挫折，因为它让我们除了纽约其他杂耍剧院，也无法登上汉默斯坦的维多利亚舞台。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
However, the manager double-crossed him by taking the stand and denying he had made any such promise to Pop. We were fined $250 and The Three Keatons were banned from the New York stage. The ban remained in force for two years and was a cruel setback for our act because it kept us off the stage of Hammerstein's Victoria along with New York's other vaudeville houses. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那时，汉默斯坦的维多利亚剧院早已被公认为美国最伟大的歌舞杂耍剧院。位于42街和百老汇（Rialto剧院现在所在地）的那座宏伟的老展厅，在它的时代是一切，也许比后来的宫殿还要多一些。就像任何一个老前辈会告诉你的那样，维多利亚是歌舞表演史上最好的。我想我们基顿家得到的最大的赞美就是每个表演季被预订4到6次。大多数演员在那里一年预定一次都很开心，受欢迎的表演通常会有两个预定。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
By that time Hammerstein's Victoria had long been recognized as America's greatest vaudeville theatre. That grand old showcase, located at 42nd Street and Broadway where the Rialto Theatre now stands, was in its day everything—and perhaps a little more —than the Palace became later. As any old-timer will tell you, Hammerstems Victoria was vaudeville at its all-time best. I suppose the greatest compliment we Keatons were ever paid was being booked there four to six times each season. Most acts were happy when they got one date a year there. Favored acts usually got two. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　最初奥斯卡·汉默斯坦建造了维多利亚，但它是由他的儿子威利经营的，威利是一位表演大师，也是奥斯卡二世的父亲，奥斯卡二世与理查德·罗杰斯（Richard Rodgers）共同创作了《俄克拉荷马！》《南太平洋》，以及其他一些戏剧趣闻。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The original Oscar Hammerstein built the Victoria, but it was run by his son Willie, a master showman and the father of Oscar II, the creator, with Richard Rodgers, of "Oklahoma!", "South Pacific," and a few other theatrical tidbits. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　威利·汉默斯坦会尝试一切——而且确实这么做了。威利喜欢这样的恶作剧，比如邀请古典舞蹈演员保罗·斯旺（Paul Swan），宣传他是“世界上最美丽的男人”，并大肆宣传他所谓的“摔跤奶酪”的东西。它有七英尺高，两英尺宽，没有一个人类摔跤冠军能让它不掉在地上。那块顽强的奶酪，当然，它底部的分量太重了，以至于它会自动直立起来。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Willie Hammerstein would try anything—and did. Willie reveled in such capers as booking Paul Swan, the classical dancer, and advertising him as "the world's most beautiful man" and giving a big publicity build-up to something he called "a wrestling cheese." This stood seven feet high, was two feet broad, and no human wrestling champion could make it stay on the floor. The indomitable cheese, of course, was so heavily weighted at the bottom that it righted itself automatically. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　威利还在他的大剧场里放满了各种怪异的景点。当埃塞尔·康拉德（Ethel Conrad）和莉莲·格雷厄姆（Lillian Graham）因枪击身价百万的酒店老板兼社会名流W·E·D·斯托克斯（W. E. D. Stokes）而被捕时，威利保释了他们，并让他们扮演“流星”。他还记录了佛罗里达女孩南·帕特森，她谋杀了她的情人凯撒·杨被判无罪。他甚至可以通过《樱桃姐妹》（Cherry Sisters）来增加票房，她们太糟糕了，不得不在她们面前竖起一个隔板，拦住观众向她们扔的蔬菜和臭鸡蛋。威利·汉默斯坦深知自己是个表演家，他让引座员把人造水果和蔬菜分发给那些没有带水果和蔬菜的人，以此增加顾客的乐趣。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Willie also filled his big playhouse with other freak attractions. When Ethel Conrad and Lillian Graham were arrested for shooting W. E. D. Stokes, a millionaire hotel owner and prominent social figure, Willie bailed them out and put them on as "The Shooting Stars." He also booked Nan Patterson, the Floradora girl, who was acquitted of murdering her lover, Caesar Young. He could even fatten the box office with the Cherry Sisters, who were so bad that a screen had to be put up in front of them to intercept the vegetables and rotten eggs audiences bombarded them with. And Willie Hammerstein, knowing showman that he was, increased the fun of his customers by having his ushers pass out artificial fruit and vegetables to those who had not brought any with them. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　歌舞杂耍是一种多样化的娱乐，威利试图给他的顾客提供世界上一切使他们开心、迷人、迷惑、惊奇或着迷的东西。我指的是所有的东西，从《永不笑的女孩，苏》（Sober Sue，&nbsp;the Girl Who Never laugh）到《会说话的狗，唐》（Don，&nbsp;the Talking Dog），吞火的人、变戏法的人、小丑、会倒退加减的人、会数数的马、情节剧、喜剧、跳高运动员、滑冰和骑自行车的篮球队。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Vaudeville is variety entertainment, and Willie tried to give his customers everything in the world that could possibly amuse, charm, bewilder, baffle, amaze, or enchant them. And I do mean everything from "Sober Sue, the Girl Who Never Laughed" to "Don, the Talking Dog," fire-eaters, jugglers, clowns, men who could add and subtract backward, horses that could count, melodramas, comedies, high divers, ice skating and bicycle-riding basketball teams. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　除了经常出现在美国最受尊敬的杂耍表演外，汉默斯坦的表演也是最有趣的。这是因为它吸引了全国最会表演的人们，其他表演者也会成群结队地前来观看。没有比其他演员的掌声更动听的了。他们是真的知道你有多好，你卖的娱乐是真的还是假的。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Besides the prestige of appearing so often in American vaudeville's most esteemed showcase, Hammerstein's was the most fun to play. This was because it attracted the most show-wise crowd in the country, for other performers attended in droves. And there is no applause so sweet to hear as that which comes from other actors. They really know whether you are any good or not, whether the entertainment you are selling is the real thing or phony. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　看过我们在汉默斯坦斯日场演出的人都不会忘记。那天，爸爸在街那头的道林酒吧多待了几分钟。他看了看表，拍了拍头，向舞台门口跑去。匆忙之中，他忘了把毛毡垫戴在裤子里。自从我们用扫帚互相做铁砧合唱，我的力气大得足以把他弄伤的时候，他就一直放个毡垫在裤子里。顺便说一下，爸爸的右臂已经强壮到正常人两倍大小，因为多年来他一直把他正在发育的儿子在舞台上扔来扔去。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Nobody who saw one matinee we played at Hammersteins ever forgot it. Pop stayed that day at Dowling's bar just down the street several minutes too long. On looking at his watch, he slapped his head and ran for the stage door. In his hurry he forgot to put on the felt pad he had been wearing under his trousers ever since I had got strong enough to hurt him when we did our anvil-chorus work on each other with the brooms. His own right arm, by the way, had swelled to twice normal size because of the years he'd been throwing his growing boy around the stage. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那天下午，像往常一样，我们面对着一群经常看我们表演的观众，他们对我们的表演套路了如指掌。那天下午，我第一次狠狠地揍了爸爸一顿，扫帚发出的声音和平常低沉的声音不一样。爸爸痛得脸色发青，跳到大约三英尺高的空中。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That afternoon, as usual, we were working before an audience that had seen our act so often they knew the routines as well as we did. The first time I whacked Pop good that afternoon the broomstick made a different sound than the usual muffled one. Pop turned green with pain and jumped about three feet in the air. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“天哪（Christ），”他呻吟道，“我忘了拿垫子了！”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Christ," he groaned, "I left the pad off!" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我想我已经提到过，在我父亲看来，没有所谓的舞台低语。但当他们听到他说出这个仍然被禁止的字眼时，整个房子都在咆哮，摇晃着。一个不那么世俗的人也会震惊的。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I have mentioned, I think, that as far as my father was concerned there was no such thing as a stage whisper. But the whole house roared and rocked as they heard him say the word that was still forbidden and would have shocked a less worldly crowd. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“你到底是怎么回事？”他问道。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Are you going through with it?" he asked. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“当然，”我说完，他皱了皱眉，“这是戏的一部分。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Sure," I said, as he winced, "it's part of the play." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我又揍了他一顿。“坚持到底？”他又问了一次。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I socked him again. "Going through with it?" he asked once more. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“是的，”我说。这次他给了我一个可怜的的眼神，说：“要记住我是你的父亲。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Yes," I said. This time he gave me an appealing look, and remarked, "But remember I'm your father." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　虽然我对他毫不留情，但他还是挺过来了。在表演结束时，浑身青紫的乔·基顿做了他最好的即兴发挥之一。他走到舞台的灯光下，用他在舞台上的一种私密的低语告诉观众，“这是我最后一次让乔治·M·科汉（George M. Cohan）为我写东西。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
And Pop did go through with it, although I showed him no mercy. At the end of the act Joe Keaton, black and blue, made one of his best ad libs. Stepping to the footlights, he told the audience, in one of his confidential stage whispers, "This is the last time I let George M. Cohan write anything for me." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸总是站在正确的立场上。有一次，观众笑不出声来，波普悲伤地对他们说：“你们对这部戏不够认真。它的重要丝毫不亚于本·胡的想象。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop was always there with the right line. Once when an audience was slow to laugh Pop told them in a sad tone, "You're not taking this production seriously enough. It is every bit as important as Ben-Hur ever thought of being." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当然，这些即兴创作在汉默斯坦剧院得到了最好的欣赏。我常常想，那些老练的百老汇观众会多么疯狂地迎接我和爸爸在公共场合上演的最疯狂的打斗。这件事发生在匹兹堡大剧院，弗里茨·席夫就是在这个剧院碰到发痒粉。争吵是因为我抽烟。当时我17岁，但像那个时代的大多数父亲一样，爸爸认为吸烟会阻碍青少年的成长，在21岁之前不应该沉迷于吸烟。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
These ad libs were best appreciated, of course, at Hammerstein's. I often think of how ecstatically that sophisticated Broadway crowd would have greeted the wildest fight Pop and I ever put on in public. This took place at the Grand Theatre in Pittsburgh, the same theatre where Fritzi Scheff was introduced to itching powder. The fight was over my smoking. I was seventeen, but like most of the fathers of that era Pop believed that smoking stunted a youth's growth and should not be indulged in until one was twenty-one. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸和妈妈都抽烟。爸爸总是用布尔达勒姆烟草卷烟。他一直把布尔达勒姆的白色小包放在上衣的右手口袋里，包上系着一包棕色的烟纸。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop and Mom both smoked themselves. Pop always rolled his own cigarettes out of Bull Durham tobacco. He kept the little white bag Bull Durham came in and the packet of brown cigarette papers attached to it in the right hand pocket of his jacket. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在那个特别的日子里，爸爸和我都穿着蓝色的哔叽面料（serge）衣服，我们把衣服并排挂在更衣室的衣橱里。在我们化妆的时候，爸爸从口袋里掏出一些烟草，却不小心在我的夹克口袋里摸到了。在化妆镜里，我看到他拿出了几天前我给自己买的斗牛犬造型烟斗。他端详了一会儿烟斗，什么也没跟我说，就把它放回了我的口袋。他没有对我提起烟斗的事，他从自己的衣服里拿出烟草和卷烟纸，自己卷了一卷，一边化完妆，一边抽着。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
On that particular day, Pop and I were wearing blue serge suits which we had hung next to each other in the dressing-room closet. While we were making up he went to get some tobacco from his pocket and by mistake fumbled for it in the pocket of my jacket. In my make-up mirror I saw him come up with the bulldog pipe I had bought myself a few days before. He studied the pipe for a moment, put it back into my pocket without saying anything to me. He said nothing to me about the pipe as he got his tobacco and cigarette papers from his own suit, rolled one for himself and smoked it while he finished putting on his make-up. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当我们被要求上台的时候，我让爸爸先离开，然后我告诉伯纳德·格兰维尔：“我今晚要上台，邦尼（伯纳德外号）。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When the call came for us to get on stage, I let Pop leave first, then I told Bernard Granville, Tm in for it tonight, Bunny." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我和老爸都是这样，我们的一套动作让我像他打我一样去打他。那天我并没有玩忽职守，尤其是在他狠狠地把我扔来扔去，把房子撞倒之后。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I was in for it but so was my old man. Our routine now had me hitting him as often and as hard as he hit me. I did not neglect my duties that day particularly after he threw me around so hard that he knocked down the house set. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　木条折断了，爸爸还在我身上摔坏了两把厨房椅子。我向他砸了三把扫帚以示报复。我还用旋转篮球把他撞倒在脚灯上，我们还把厨房的桌子摔在对方身上。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
This broke the batten. Pop also broke two kitchen chairs on me. I retaliated by breaking three brooms on him. I also knocked him over the footlights with the aid of my whirling basketball. We also dropped the kitchen table on one another. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那天下午，格兰德音乐厅里有一群典型的上流社会观众，他们尽情地享受着，就像在看冰淇淋工厂里无拘无束玩耍的孤儿一样。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
There was a typical high-class audience at the Grand that afternoon, and they enjoyed it with the uninhibited abandon of orphans turned loose in an ice-cream plant. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们摇摇晃晃地回到更衣室后，爸爸从我的衣服里拿出我的斗牛犬烟斗和烟草，把它们拍在桌子上。这是他承认的方式，我得到了他的允许，可以当着他的面或背着他抽烟。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After we staggered back to the dressing room, Pop got my bulldog pipe and smoking tobacco from my suit and slapped them on the table. It was his way of acknowledging that I had won his permission to smoke in his presence or behind his back. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那天下午，两名医生和两名按摩师让我们恢复到足够好的状态，以便晚上演出。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That afternoon it took two doctors and two masseurs to get us back into good enough shape to work the evening performance. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我常常在想，如果爸爸知道我在同一年喝了第一杯威士忌，他会怎么做。这件事发生在我们暑假在马斯基根的时候。甚至当我还是个襁褓中的婴儿时，也曾喝过几口啤酒。那个时候，大多数人认为啤酒是一种健康饮料，介于补品和药物之间。他们甚至赋予它完整性，称为“诚实的啤酒。”但威士忌不同。正如牧师们和报纸社论告诉我们的那样，威士忌纯粹是邪恶的，显然是在地狱中蒸馏出来的。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I have often wondered what Pop would have done if he had learned that same year that I had taken my first drink of whiskey. That had happened during our summer vacation at Muskegon. Even as a babe-in-arms I had been given sips of beer. Most people in those days thought of beer as a health drink, something between a tonic and medicine. They even endowed it with an integrity all its own, spoke of the "honest glass of beer." But whiskey was different. Whiskey, as the ministers and newspaper editorials told us, was pure evil, apparently being distilled in hell itself. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我的第一杯酒是和布拉夫顿的朋友莱克斯·尼尔一起喝的，他19岁，比我大两岁，后来成为了一名作曲家，也是我的写笑料人。他刚刚被镇上的美女甩了，这种侮辱让我比莱克斯本人更生气。但我已经不记得她的名字了。我现在只记得她是马斯克贡水厂厂长的女儿。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That first drink of mine was taken with a Bluffton pal, Lex Neal, who was nineteen, two years older than I, who later became a song writer, and a gag man for me. He had just been given the brushoff by the town beauty, an indignity that angered me more than it did Lex himself. But I no longer remember her name. All I now recall about her is that she was the daughter of the Commissioner of the Muskegon County Water Works. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“我要证明我是你真正的朋友，”我对他说，“不让你一个人喝醉。我也要喝醉。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I'll prove I am your true friend," I told him, "by not letting you get soused alone. I'll get drunk too."
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这似乎是完美的一天。除了莱科斯的爱情悲剧、我们的棒球队又输了另一场比赛。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
It seemed a perfect day for it. In addition to Lex's love tragedy, our baseball team had just lost another game. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　莱科斯和我都不敢在布拉夫顿的帕斯科酒馆要一瓶威士忌。我们请经营旅游营地的菲尼先生为我们买下它，他照做了。这差事有点困难，因为他营地的几间小屋和帐篷是为露营和野餐准备的——坐落在大约90英尺高的悬崖上。你只能爬摇摇欲坠的木梯才能进出菲尼的营地。那天下午，当热心的菲尼先生拿着威士忌回来时，莱科斯和我一起喝了那瓶酒，并对女人的背信弃义进行了哲学思考。我们还向彼此承诺，无论那些想要诱骗我们的女孩有多漂亮，我们都不会结婚。夜幕降临时，我烂醉如泥。但莱科斯之前有过一点喝威士忌的经验，他的状态要好一些。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Neither Lex nor myself had the nerve to ask for a bottle of whiskey at the one place in Bluffton you could, Pasco's Tavern. We asked Mr. Feeney, who ran a tourist camp, to buy it for us which he did. The errand entailed a little difficulty as his campreally a few shacks and tents for campers and picnickers—was situated on a bluff about ninety feet high. You could only get to and from Feeney's camp by climbing a rickety wooden ladder. When the obliging Mr. Feeney came back with the whiskey that afternoon, Lex and I drank the bottle between us while exchanging philosophical reflections on the perfidious nature of women. We also promised each other never to marry no matter how beautiful the girls were who attempted to trap us. When darkness fell I was blotto. But Lex, having had some slight previous whiskeydrinking experience, was in somewhat better shape. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他尽了最大的努力把我从菲尼那摇摇晃晃的梯子上扶下来。但那是一个没有月亮的夜晚，我还没走一两步就掉到了山底，不过没有受伤，因为那里的沙子很软，上面还覆盖着茂密的草。但我的摔倒让莱克斯意识到我根本无法回家。相反，他带我去了他自己的家，在那里，他的母亲，一个体弱多病的南方老太太人，抽着一个玉米芯烟斗，把我放在床上，照顾我熬过了第二天早上那可怕的宿醉。那次经历之后，我再也没有喝过威士忌，直到几年后我在第一次世界大战中成为一名士兵。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
He did his best to help me down Feeney's rickety ladder. But it was a moonless night, and before I took more than a step or two I fell to the bottom—without being hurt though, as the sand there was very soft and covered by thick clumps of grass. But my fall awoke Lex to the fact that I was in no shape to go home. Instead he took me to his own house where his mother, a frail old Southern woman who smoked a corncob pipe, put me to bed and nursed me through my terrible hang-over the next morning. After that experience I never took another drink of whiskey until I became a soldier in World War I years later. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在大约十年的时间里，我的生活都像布思·塔金顿（Booth Tarkington）那样，过着梦幻般的夏天，冬天则在全国各地扮小丑。我一直喜欢表演，但这是一项艰苦的工作，有时也不怎么有趣。例如，在星期一的日场演出中，我们不得不把我们17分钟的表演延长到一个半小时，同时等待安排好的演员跟着我们到后台组装设备。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
For about ten years my life followed that same pattern of dreamlike Booth Tarkington summers, with the winter months spent clowning our way around the country. I always liked performing. But it was hard work, and there were occasions when it was not exactly fun. There was, for example, the Monday matinee we had to stretch out our seventeen-minute act for more than an hour and a half while waiting for the act scheduled to follow us to assemble its equipment backstage. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这些设备需要组装起来，因为这是一场被称为“克拉克博士的死亡之球”的冒险表演。那是一个巨大的球体，由纵横交错、间隔几英寸的钢条组成。一名摩托车手钻进球里，开始慢慢地绕着它较低的部分骑，一边提高速度，一边让轰鸣的摩托车在两边越骑越高。当他开始在这个大球里转圈到头朝下骑时，这一幕达到了高潮。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That equipment was something to put together, for the act was a daredevil turn called "Dr. Clark's Globe of Death." This was an immense sphere made of crisscross strips of steel placed inches apart from one another. A motorcyclist got inside this, started riding slowly around the lower part of it, increasing his speed as he made the roaring motorcycle travel higher and higher around the sides. The climax of the act came when he started doing loop the loops, riding upside down, inside the big globe. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那个星期一下午，我们已经站在舞台上了，酒店经理示意我们尽可能长时间地演出。克拉克博士的大型设备似乎还没有送到剧院。当它完成时，需要相当长的时间来安装和连接在一起。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We were already on stage that Monday afternoon when the house manager signaled to us to keep going as long as possible. Dr. Clark's massive equipment, it appeared, had not even arrived at the theatre. When it did it would take quite a long time to set up and bolt together. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸走向舞台灯光。“下一个表演很精彩，”他说，“但组装起来要花很长时间，所以如果你们当中有人想回家洗那些留在水槽里的盘子，我完全能理解。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop stepped to the footlights. "The next act is a great act," he said, "but it takes a long time to assemble, so if any of you want to go home and wash those dishes you left in the sink, well understand." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　没有人离开。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Nobody left. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在我们完成了所有的套路演出后，爸爸说：“巴斯特，背诵一些东西。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After we finished all our routines, Pop said, "Buster, recite something.' 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我背诵了《男孩站在燃烧的甲板上》。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I recited The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“背诵点别的，”爸爸说。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Recite something else," Pop said. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我背完了，当他要求我再讲第三段背诵时，我告诉他：“我背诵的段子已经用完了，我知道一个模仿，但不是我的，是霍伊和李的，我们必须得到他们的许可才能唱。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I did. When he asked for a third bit of elocution I told him, "I've run out of recitations. I do know a parody, but it doesn't belong to me. It belongs to Hoey and Lee, and we have to get their permission before I can sing it." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“如果你给他们版税，他们不会起诉你或杀你，”乔说。“我允许你。我会承担责任的。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"They'll not sue you or kill you either if you send them royalties," said Joe. "I give you permission. I'll take the responsibility." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　一切都很可爱，我唱了这首歌。但你能在舞台上这么可爱多久？过了一会儿，酒店经理示意我们，死亡之球的部分终于到了。我们可以听到舞台工作人员在后台组装。但那要花很长时间。当我们想不出还有什么事可做时，爸爸喊道：“拉上幕布。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
All very cute, and I sang the song. But how long can you keep on being cute on the stage? After a while the house manager signaled us that the sections of the Globe of Death had at last arrived. We could hear the stage crew starting to assemble it backstage. But that would take a good deal of time. When we couldn't think of one more thing to do, Pop yelled, "Pull up the curtain." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在那里，他们还在试图拼凑死亡之球。爸爸和我心甘情愿地开始工作，帮助工作人员，但实际上却妨碍了他们，因为我们把裤子和其他衣服碎片钉在了这个大球上。尽管有我们的帮助，他们最终还是把东西组装起来，四周用钢梁支撑着。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Back there they were still trying to put the Globe of Death together. Pop and I went to work with a ready will, helping the crew but really hampering them by getting our pants and other bits of clothing riveted to the big globe. Despite our assistance, they finally put together the thing, which was propped up on all sides by steel girders. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　到那时，我们已经在台上呆了1小时35分钟。那是我唯一一次希望自己是阿尔·乔尔森，能在任何时候让观众着迷好几个小时。

By that time we had been on the stage for an hour and thirtyfive minutes. It was the one time that I wished I was Al Jolson who could hold any audience spellbound for hours whenever he felt like it.

　　有一天晚上，一项更艰巨的任务出现了，我们必须与一具刚被杀死的尸体竞争。这也发生在匹兹堡的大剧院，我和爸爸在那里上演了我们最激烈的搏斗，并观看了Vaffaire的发痒粉演出。这一次，刚刚与乔治·M·科汉离婚的埃塞尔·利维（Ethel Levey）成为了头条。她走在我们前面。在她第二首歌唱到一半的时候，一个疯子站了起来，拔出一把左轮手枪对准了她。当她尖叫着跑下舞台时，那个男人把枪对准自己，一枪爆头。他甚至不认识埃塞尔·利维。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
An even tougher assignment came one night when we had to compete with a freshly killed corpse. This also happened at the Grand Theatre in Pittsburgh where Pop and I had staged our biggest fight and watched Vaffaire itching powder. This time Ethel Levey, recently divorced from George M. Cohan, was the headliner. She went on just before us. In the middle of her second song a maniac in a box stood up, drew a revolver and pointed it at her. When she ran screaming off the stage the man turned the gun on himself and blew his brains out. He had not even known Ethel Levey.

　　尽管处于半歇斯底里状态的利维小姐，还是被哄回来完成她的表演。然后，三基顿继续表演他们的滑稽表演。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Though still half hysterical, Miss Levey was coaxed into coming back to finish her act. Then The Three Keatons went on and did their hilarious act.

　　注：尸体赢了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
P.S. The corpse won. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　奇怪的是，其他演员的滑稽表演给我们带来了舞台上非常紧张的时刻。这一切都不是恶意的。他们很自然地会做他们能想到的任何事情——让我们这种以不可能被颠覆而自豪的行为陷入恐慌。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Oddly enough, the clowning of other acts gave us other very tense moments on the stage. None of this was ill-intentioned. It was natural for them to do everything they could think of to throw into a panic any act like ours which prided itself on being impossible to upset. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这些恶作剧的灵感大多来自于我们在一个套路中所做的改变。现在，当爸爸背诵他那首“美丽的诗”时，我会从他身后出来，拿着扫帚在地板上猛敲，发出可怕的噪音。我继续用扫帚猛摔地板。当棍子穿过一个洞时，观众意识到我在做什么，我掀翻了，当我撞到地板上时，又发出了可怕的噪音。爸爸被激怒了，他会把我踢开，然后抓住扫帚的尾部。在我不需要的帮助下把扫帚拿出来扔掉，然后平静地继续他的背诵。这应该是套路的结束部分。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Most of these capers were inspired by a change we'd made in one routine. Now, when Pop recited his "beautiful poem," I would come out behind him and make a terrible racket by banging a broomstick on the floor. I continued slamming the broom on the floor. The audience realized what I was doing when the stick went through a hole. This upended me, and when I hit the floor I made another terrible noise. Exasperated, Pop would kick me out of his way and grab the business end of the broom. On pulling this up with my unwanted assistance, he would throw it away and then calmly continue his recitation just where he'd left off. That was supposed to be the end of the routine.

　　但是卡岑贾玛精神（Katzenjammer spirit）激励其他表演者做出新的情节转折和复杂化。我们在纽约凯斯殖民剧院演出时，有几个家伙偷偷溜到舞台下面的地下室，把一根正好175英尺长的绳子系在从洞里飞出来的扫帚头上。我和爸爸打着手势唱着《伏尔加船歌》，最后把所有的绳子都系上了一面又脏又小的美国国旗。机智的管弦乐队立刻演奏《星条旗永不落》（The Star Spangled Banner）。当我们在殖民结束了那周的活动后，我们松了一口气。不过消息传开了，别的剧院里又有新的疯狂戏法等着我们。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
But the Katzenjammer spirit of the other acts on the bill inspired them to contribute new plot turns and complications. When we were playing Keiths Colonial Theatre in New York, a couple of those fellows sneaked down to the basement under the stage and tied a rope exactly 175 feet long to the end of the broomstick when it came through the hole. When Pop and I, singing "The Volga Boat Song" complete with gestures, eventually got all the rope up a dirty, tiny American flag was tied to it. The quick-witted orchestra immediately swung into "The Star Spangled Banner." But we were relieved when we finished that week at the Colonial. However word had got around, and new crazy tricks awaited us in the other theatres.

　　第二周，一个演员在洞下放了一个梯子。当扫帚杆落下时，他们已经站在梯子上，迅速地在扫帚杆上涂新鲜的芥末。在我们演出的下一个剧院里，两个人紧紧抓住扫帚，而爸爸也拼命地拽着。他们突然松开了手，砰的一声，爸爸飞到了大约三英尺高的空中。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The next week an act put a ladder under the hole. When the broom stick went down they were on the ladder and quickly covered the stick with fresh mustard. At the next theatre we played, two guys on the bill hung onto the broomstick while Pop tugged away like mad. They let go suddenly, and Pop went about three feet in the air as it came up. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　有一次，扫帚来了，上面写着我们两周后就要关门的通知。在另一次表演中，他们不厌其烦地在洞下面放了一个巨大的弹弓。他们一放手，扫帚飞快地弹出去。它飞得如此之快，以至于爸爸都没有看到扫帚从他身边飞过。几分钟后，他看到扫帚下来了。作为表演的一部分，我们正在把愤怒的脸挨得很近进行争吵，这时扫帚以惊人的速度从我们鼻子中间嗖地飞了下来。当然，它像箭一样落下来了。如果被它砸到，我们都不需要假装摔倒。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Once when the broom came up it had our two weeks' closing notice on it. At still another show they took the trouble to put a huge slingshot below the hole. When they let this go the broom shot away into the flies. It traveled so fast that Pop didn't even see it rocket past him. He saw it come down though a few minutes later. We were arguing, as part of the act, with our angry faces very close together when the broom whizzed down between our noses at terrific speed. It came down, of course, stick first, like an arrow. Neither of us would have needed to fake a fall if it had hit.

　　当我们在上百老汇表演基思的“阿尔罕布拉”时，其他表演者从水族馆买了一条几英尺长的鳗鱼。他们在地铁上用装满水的五加仑罐子把它带到了剧院。当绳子末端出现这条鳗鱼时，乔·基顿妆容下脸都青了，他认为那是条蛇。鳗鱼扭动着从舞台上爬过，扫帚还绑在上面。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When we were playing Keith's Alhambra, also on Upper Broadway, the other acts went down to the Battery and got an eel several feet long from the Aquarium. This they brought up to the theatre on the subway in a five-gallon can filled with water. When this came up on the end of the rope, Joe Keaton turned green under his make-up, believing it was a snake. The eel wriggled away across the stage with the broom still tied to it.

　　同一季在加拿大渥太华上演的另一出戏“三个雷顿”（The Three Leightons），捉弄我们的滑稽把戏很可能会造成悲剧。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The comical trick played on us by another act, The Three Leightons, that same season in Ottawa, Canada, easily might have had tragic results. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那是1915年，第一次世界大战的第二年，整个加拿大都在为精锐兵团“公主帕特”（Princess Pats）哀悼，这个兵团最近在伊普尔几乎全军覆没。于是，当雷顿兄弟不断威胁要在我们的扫帚上系一面德国国旗时，他们表演了歌曲、舞蹈和喜剧，让我们非常紧张。当然，我们都假装把这当成一个玩笑，但每次爸爸拔起扫帚时，我都试图往洞里看，看上面是否有旗子。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
It was 1915, the second year of World War I, and all Canada was in mourning for its crack regiment, The Princess Pats, which recently had been all but exterminated at Ypres. So the Leighton Brothers, who did a song, dance, and comedy turn, got us very nervous when they kept threatening to tie a German flag to our broom. Naturally we pretended to take this as a joke, but each time Pop pulled up the broom I tried to peer down the hole to see if a flag was on it. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　有一天，我确实看到扫帚上飘着一面旗子。当扫帚拔出来时，我猛地把绳子砍断。在匆忙中我没砍在绳子上，却击中了扫帚，被砍成两截。但这并没有阻止国旗拉起。晚安！拉出来的是英国国旗。爸爸和我吓得跑向舞台侧面，他跑向一边，我跑向另一边。我们跑到视观众线之外，停下来听了听，有点想听到人们的咆哮和嘶嘶声，但我们听到的只有笑声。爸爸和我隔着空荡荡的舞台面面相觑，我们以为我们刚刚侮辱了英国国旗。然后我们把头探了出来，人们还在笑，于是我们勇敢地冲出去鞠躬。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
One day I did see a flag fluttering on the end of the broom. As it came up, I slashed away at the string. In my haste, I missed the string and hit the broom which broke in two. But this didn't stop the flag coming up. And good night! It turned out to be the Union Jack that I had slammed away at. Pop and I raced for the wings, he going one way, I the other. The moment we were out of sight we stopped to listen, half expecting to hear the people roaring and hissing. But all we heard was laughter. Pop and I looked at one another across the empty stage where we thought we had just dishonored the British flag. Then we stuck out our heads. The people were still laughing, so we courageously rushed out to take our bow. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我的猜测是，当观众看到我们惊恐的表情时，他们意识到我们和他们看到国旗拉起时一样惊讶，而且我在认出它之前就已经挥了它。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
My guess is that the audience realized when they saw our horrified faces that we were just as surprised as they were when the flag came up, and that I had swung at it before recognizing it.

　　我们迅速地对“三个雷顿”进行了报复。第二天早上，我去了渥太华的滨河区，在几个小男孩的帮助下，收集了18只猫。我们把猫带到剧院的道具室，放在利顿夫妇演出时用的行李箱。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We had a speedy revenge on The Three Leightons. The next morning I went down to Ottawa's river-front district and, with the assistance of several small boys, collected eighteen cats. These we brought to the theatre's prop room and put in a trunk that the Leightons used in their act. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　不想对猫太粗暴，我在箱的两侧钻了气孔。在他们的表演中，一个雷顿家的人对另一个扮演黑人侍者的人说：“孩子，打开我的箱子，拿出我的游行服！”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Not wishing to be too rough on the cats I drilled airholes in the sides of the trunk. In their act one of the Leightons told another, playing a Negro bellhop, "Boy, open my trunk and get out my parade suit!" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那天下午，当箱子被打开时，那些猫又愤怒又恐怖地咆哮着跳出来，向四面八方飞奔而去。他们跑进了舞台侧面，爬进了幕布风景，消失在了吊景里。另一些跳进包厢，跑到管弦乐队的过道上。不用说，这场演出在很长一段时间里都是一片混乱。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That afternoon when the trunk was opened the cats, snarling with rage and terror, leaped out and streaked in every direction. They ran into the wings, climbed up into the scenery, and disappeared into the flies. Others jumped into the boxes and ran up the orchestra aisles. Pandemonium, needless to say, was the rule for quite a while at that performance. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我再说一遍，所有这些胡闹都是完全没有恶意的。在我看来，当时的表演者对于开玩笑远没有今天的明星那么敏感。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Now all of this clowning and teasing and horsing around, I repeat, was done utterly without malice. It seems to me that actors, generally speaking, were then far less sensitive to being kidded than today's stars are. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当然，当时在演艺界一夜暴富是不可能的。你的学徒生涯很艰苦，要花好几年才完成。宣传还处于初级阶段。没有人能把你的长相、身材或风流韵事放在公众面前。没有能引起其他明星嫉妒的电视收视率。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Of course, it was impossible then to make a fortune overnight in show business. Your apprenticeship was arduous and took years to complete. Publicity was in its infancy. Nobody could put you over with the public on your looks, your figure, or your sensational love affairs. There were no TV ratings to arouse the jealousy of other stars. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　表现是重要的，几乎是唯一重要的。那位想知道你是否优秀的经理顺便到你工作的剧院看看你，他自己做的决定，不依赖于那些数学奇才的计算，那些奇才曾说服他，只要从几个男人和家庭主妇那里得到意见，就能知道数百万人对一个明星的看法。相反，他衡量你的标准是从付费来看你表演的人，他们得到的接待。至于宣传，我们的感觉就像乔治·M·科汉（George M. Cohan）对一名记者说的那样：“孩子，我不在乎你怎么写我，只要你把我的名字拼对就行。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Performance was the important thing, almost the only thing that counted. The manager who wanted to know if you were any good dropped in at a theatre where you were working and decided for himself. He didn't depend on the calculations of mathematical wizards who had convinced him that they could tell what millions of persons thought of a star after getting opinions from a handful of men and housewives. Instead, he measured your effectiveness by the reception you got from the men and women who paid to see you. As for publicity we felt as George M. Cohan did when he told a reporter, "I don't care what you write about me, kid, as long as you spell my name right." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当然，在杂耍表演中，我们没有宣传方面的问题，除非像乔·基顿这样的冒险精神愚蠢地试图攫取一些自由空间。当地的报纸每周都为这家杂耍剧院做广告，大多数时候，他们会发布一些关于下一个演出中出现的演员传记，还有一些恭维的评论。但这些都出现在娱乐版块，占据很少的空间。本世纪初，美国的种族歧视和宗教偏见现象普遍存在，但当时和现在一样，最不可能找到这两种歧视的地方就是娱乐业。这让我想起了一件小事情，这件事当时可能让比尔·罗宾森（Bill Bojangles Robinson）很丢脸，但后来他回忆起这件事时觉得很好笑。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
In vaudeville, of course, we had no publicity problem except when some adventurous spirit like Joe Keaton foolishly tried to snatch some free space. Most of the time local newspapers, who ran the vaudeville theatre's advertising each week, published a few biographical notes about the acts appearing on the next bill, and also flattering reviews. But these appeared in the entertainment section and occupied little space. Those early years of the century were a time of widespread racial and religious prejudice in America, but the last place to look for either then as now was show business. This reminds me of a little incident which may have humiliated Bill (Bojangles) Robinson at the time, but which he recalled with amusement later on.

<details><summary>
　　我大约七岁的时候，我们第一次和比尔.罗宾逊一起演出。到了那周的星期二，罗宾逊已经身无分文，而且已经从演员表上的所有成年人借了钱。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I was about seven years old when we first worked on a bill with Bojangles. By Tuesday of that week Robinson was broke and had borrowed money from all of the grownups on the bill. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　虽然我很小，但口袋里总是有着钱，他听到这个脸一下亮了起来。星期三他向我借了两美元，并答应还钱，但忘了说要得等到星期六他拿到一周的薪水才能还。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
His face lighted up on hearing that, small though I was, I always had money in my pocket. On Wednesday he borrowed two dollars from me. He promised to pay it back but neglected to mention I'd have to wait until Saturday when he got his week's pay. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　之前没有人向我借过钱，我对这笔交易印象深刻。从那以后每次表演我都问罗宾逊：“比尔先生，我的两美元在哪里？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Nobody else had ever borrowed money from me, and I was very impressed by the transaction. But at every performance after that I asked Robinson, "Mr. Bill, where is my two dollars?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这使他越来越沮丧，但他设法熬到星期五。然后，他再也忍受不了催促了，走到爸爸跟前说：“乔先生，我不知道你是否同意，我向巴斯特借了两美元，从那以后他每分钟都向我要钱。乔先生，你能不能给我两美元，明天晚上还你，我现在就可以付给巴斯特，不再让他向我要钱了？”爸爸给了比尔两美元，他把钱给了我，第二天便把钱还给了父亲。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
This depressed him more and more, but he managed to take it until Friday. Then, unable to stand any more dunning, he approached Pop and said, "Mr. Joe, I don't know whether you will approve of this, but I borrowed two dollars from Buster. He has been asking me for it every minute since. Mr. Joe, could you let me have two dollars until tomorrow night so I can pay Buster and not have him asking me for his money any more?" Pop gave Bill the two dollars, and he gave it to me and paid back my father next day.

　　大约30年后，比尔在二十世纪福克斯与秀兰·邓波儿（Shirley Temple）一起演出时，在片场遇到了我。当时他正与当时的制片总监达瑞尔·扎努克（Darryl Zanuck）一起走着。我们停下来聊天，突然比尔转向扎努克说：“扎努克先生，永远不要向那个人借钱！”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
About thirty years later when Bill was playing with Shirley Temple at Twentieth Century-Fox he encountered me on the lot. He was walking with Darryl Zanuck, then the studio's production chief. We stopped to chat. Suddenly Bill turned to Zanuck and said, "Mr. Zanuck, don't ever borrow any money from that man!"

　　虽然戏剧行业是第一个突破肤色界限的行业，但在我的童年和青年时期，你从未看过白人和黑人同时出现在舞台上。在歌舞杂耍或百老汇，黑人女演员很少。我记得第一次看到的是艾达·沃克（Ada Walker），乔治·沃克（George Walker）的妻子，伯特·威廉姆斯（Bert Williams）的搭档，当时她与威廉姆斯和沃克一起出现在一个全黑人的讽刺剧中，顺便唱了一首《光辉》（Shine），这首歌至今仍是人们的最爱。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Although the theatrical profession was the first to break through the color line, throughout my boyhood and youth you never saw whites and Negroes on a stage at the same time. There were very few Negro women performers in vaudeville or on Broadway. The first I recall seeing was Ada Walker, the wife of George Walker, the partner of Bert Williams, when she appeared with Williams and Walker in an all-Negro revue and incidentally sang "Shine," which is still a perennial favorite.

　　当黑人被允许进入白人酒吧时，他们被限制在离门最远的酒吧尽头。那天晚上，爸爸走进波士顿的亚当斯酒吧时，没有理会这一点。这家酒吧的位置很方便，就在基思剧院的正后方。伯特·威廉姆斯也和我们一起出现在了表演者清单上，按照要求排在了清单的最后。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When Negroes were allowed in white saloons at all they were restricted to the end of the bar farthest from the door. Pop ignored this the night he walked into the Adams Hotel bar in Boston, which was conveniently situated, being directly behind Keith's Theatre. Bert Williams, who was again on the bill with us, was standing, as required, far down at the other end. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“伯特，”爸爸说，“上来和我喝一杯。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Bert," said Pop, "come up here and have a drink with me." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　伯特紧张地看了看酒吧里的一张白脸，又看了看另一张白脸，回答说：“乔先生，我想我最好呆在这里。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Bert looked nervously from one white face at the bar to another, and replied, "Think I better stay down here, Mr. Joe." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“好吧，”爸爸说，拿起他的杯子，“那我下去找你。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"All right," said Pop, picking up his glass, "then I'll have to come down there to you." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我并不是说爸爸没有种族歧视。他不知道什么是种族歧视，没有人告诉过他有这样的事情。就像那个时代的大多数人一样，如果他对一个人做的事深恶痛绝，而那个人又是犹太人，他就叫他“该死的犹太佬”。如果那个冒犯的人是意大利人，老爹就骂他是“肮脏的意大利佬”。如果他是爱尔兰人，就叫他“又烂又蠢的爱尔兰佬”。但这与其说是对他的种族的谴责，不如说是因为对方是个无赖。我想，老爹的一场罕见的酒吧大战说明了这一点。在那个时候，爸爸的敌人中至少有三个是犹太人。其中的两位，E. F. 阿尔比和马丁·贝克，是杂耍界的大亨，他们曾与爸爸争吵多年。第三位是杂耍漫画家伯特·列维（Bert Levy）， 爸爸永远不会原谅他，因为列维曾为他拍过一份电报，但没有及时送达，导致我们失去了预约。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I am not making the point that Pop had no race prejudice. He didn't know what race prejudice was. Nobody had told him that there was such a thing. Like most people in those days if he resented bitterly something a man did and that man was a Jew he called him a "damned sheeny." If the offensive one was Italian, Pop denounced him as a "dirty dago." If he was Irish he called him a "rotten, dumb mick." But this was more a matter of identifying the rascal than denouncing him because of his race. One of Pop's rare barroom battles illustrates the point, I think. At the time at least three of Pop's best enemies were Jews. Two of them, E. F. Albee and Martin Beck, were vaudeville tycoons with whom he had quarreled for years. The third one was Bert Levy, the vaudeville cartoonist, whom Pop had never forgiven because Levy had taken a telegram for him once and failed to pass it on promptly, causing us to lose a booking. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸不能忍受的是看到另一个人受到不公正的对待。如果你是受害者，那你的种族就不算什么了，他自然而然地站在你这边。

What Pop could not endure was seeing another human being mistreated or unfairly dealt with. If you were being victimized your race didn't count. He was automatically on your side.

　　我想我之前提到过，我的父亲是这个国家最好的拳手之一。但我怀疑我已经强调过他能把自己的脚和腿变成什么样的非凡武器。他的脚和手一样快，腿的柔韧性灵活性使他比任何其他拳手有很大的优势。有一天，他在帮帕斯科先生准备鲜鱼晚餐时，展示了它们惊人的灵活性。一个脾气暴躁的客人把盘子拿回柜台，抱怨它不新鲜。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I think I have mentioned that my father was one of the country's best rough-and-tumble fighters. I doubt though that I have emphasized what extraordinary weapons he could turn his feet and legs into. His feet were as fast as his hands, and the flexibility of his legs gave him a big edge over any other stand-up fighter. He demonstrated their amazing flexibility one day when he was helping Mr. Pasco serve a fresh fish dinner. One crabby guest brought his plate back to the counter and complained that it wasn't fresh.

　　爸爸在柜台的另一边。当动口已经不能解决问题时，爸爸把腿甩到柜台上，用脚勾住那人的后脖颈，把他的头往前拉，直到离自己的头只有两英寸，然后说：“这是新鲜的鲈鱼，把它吃掉。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop was on the other side of the counter. When all verbal arguments failed, Pop swung his leg over the counter, snagged the back of the man's neck with his foot, pulled his head forward until it was only two inches from his own, and said, "It's fresh perch, and you'll eat it."

</summary><font color=gray><br>
As a result of throwing me around the stage for so many years Pop's right arm became twice the size of his left. He demonstrated its punching power to the whole family one morning in Los Angeles. This was at the time when vaccination became compulsory. A great many people, including my parents, were rebelling against it. Some children died after being inoculated, and the number of these deaths was not underestimated, I imagine, for they were talked about all over the country. </font></details>

　　我们在洛杉矶的一家酒店里，医学界试图给我们接种疫苗。有人敲了我们旅馆房间的门，爸爸去开门，发现那儿有三个人——一个卫生官员，一个旅馆医生，还有一个侦探。当他们宣布他们的目的时，他用皮带狠狠地打在卫生官员的鼻子上，把他和他后面的人都撞倒了。他们像九柱戏一样倒下；爸爸砰地一声关上了门。我们在一个小时内就收拾好了行李，搬到另一家酒店，再也没有为接种疫苗而烦恼。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We were in a Los Angeles hotel when the medical profession attempted to vaccinate us. Someone knocked on our hotel-room door, Pop answered and found three men there—a county health officer, the hotel physician, and a house detective. When they announced their purpose, he belted the county health officer in the nose so hard that he knocked down both him and the other men behind him. They went down like ninepins; Pop slammed the door. We packed within the hour, moved to another hotel, and were never bothered again about being vaccinated.

　　出于某种原因，爸爸在同时和几个人战斗时也不落下风。我怀疑他认为这对反对派来说既有趣又公平。在一个星期六的晚上，当他走进康西丁的大都市酒店时，他的拳击天赋无疑帮助了他。当时，这里是纽约最受欢迎的男性运动员聚集地。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
For some reason Pop was at his best when fighting more than one man at a time. I have a suspicion he considered it both more fun and fairer to the opposition. He certainly was helped by his talent for fighting with his feet one Saturday night when he entered Considine's Metropole, then the most popular gathering place for sporting men in New York.

　　“我想你也是犹太人吧，”一个大学生说。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I suppose you re a Jew too," said one college boy.

　　“我告诉过你不要碰他，”当另外两个年轻人推搡着陌生人时，我父亲喊道。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I told you to let him alone," yelled my father when the other two youngsters jostled the stranger. The third boy said to my father:

　　第三个男孩对我父亲说：“我问你一件事。你是犹太人吗？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I asked you something. Are you a Jew?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“我当然是，”爸爸说的话让酒保大吃一惊，因为他多年来一直是爱尔兰人身份。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I certainly am," announced Pop, astonishing the bartender, who had known him for years as an Irishman. 
</font></details>

　　学生们开始向他靠拢，一个人打了一拳。爸爸躲开了这一拳，用脚干掉了三个男孩中的两个，又用一记右上勾拳把第三个男孩从康西丁的窗户打了出去。酒保和矮小的犹太绅士都盯着破碎的玻璃，然后又盯着地上两个失去知觉的年轻运动员。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The collegiates began to close in on him. One threw a punch. Pop ducked the blow, took out two of the three boys with his feet, and with a right uppercut belted the third one clean through Considine's window. The bartender and the little Jewish gentleman both stared at the shattered glass, then at the two unconscious young athletes on the floor.

　　“基顿先生，你想来点什么？”酒保说。

"Well, what will you have, Mr. Keaton?" said the bartender.

　　乔揉了揉他的右手指关节，思考着，然后他说：“我想喝杯啤酒。”他说他要请那个小犹太人喝一杯，但他觉得他已经为小犹太人做得够多了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Joe rubbed the knuckles of his right hand as he reflected, then he said, "I think 111 have a beer." He said he was going to ask the little Jewish fellow to have a drink but decided he'd done enough for him already. 
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　就在他喝啤酒的时候，康西丁的一名侍者溜出了大都会酒店，叫来了正在巡逻的胖警察。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Meanwhile, as he sipped his beer, one of Considine's waiters slipped out of the Metropole and summoned the fat cop on the beat.

　　带着爸爸去警察局的路上，警察问：“你为什么不跑？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
On the way to the police station with Pop, the policeman asked, "Why didn't you run?"

　　乔的脸上绽出幸福的笑容，“是不是太晚了？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Joe's face broke into a happy smile, "Is it too late?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“是的，”警察伤心地说，“现在太晚了，警官知道了这件事。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Yes," said the cop sadly, " 'It's too late now. The desk sergeant knows about it."

　　我和妈妈第一次知道这事是通过霍华德兄弟的乔治·霍华德，乔治·霍华德是一个很棒的班卓琴演奏队。他在妈妈玩皮诺奇勒牌时突然闯进来，出现的时机不太好，妈妈刚出了350美元的黑桃，那是双倍的价钱。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The first Mom and I knew about it was when George Howard, of the Howard Brothers, a great banjo-stjimraiing team, came bursting in on the pinochle game. His timing was bad—Mom had just bid 350 in spades, which pays double. 
</font></details>

　　“迈拉，”乔治叫道，“乔被关在西47街车站的房子里。他在康西丁的餐厅打昏了三个人。要用250美元保释他。”

"Myra," George exclaimed, "Joe's locked up in the West 47th Street station house. He knocked three guys cold in Considine's. They're holding him in $250 bail."

　　矮小的妈妈不得不坐在两个枕头上才能和其他玩家在同一高度，她只是瞪着其他两名玩家。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Little Mom, who had to sit on a couple of pillows to be on the same level with the other players, just glared at the other two players. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“我出三五十（350美元）！”她好斗地说。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I bid three fifty!" she said belligerently. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　乔治似乎觉得妈妈没有听到他的话。“迈拉，我说乔被关起来了，而且……”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
George seemed to think Mom had not heard him. "Myra, I said Joe is locked up and . . ." 
</font></details>

　　妈妈挥手叫他安静。当没有人出价比她高时，她把黑桃和其他牌一口气全部打出，，轻松地赢了。等到她赢了钱，才转身问乔治：
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Mom waved to him to be quiet. When no one outbid her, she laid down her spade flush and other meld, played out the hand, and won easily. Only when she had collected her winnings did she turn to George, and ask: 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“你刚才说乔需要多少保释金？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"How much bail money did you say Joe needs?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“二五十，也就是250美元。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Two fifty. Two hundred and fifty dollars, that is."

　　像大多数杂耍表演者一样，爸爸不喜欢马丁·贝克，他经营着奥芬巡回演出，这是芝加哥和所有西部地区的一流巡回演出。作为“白老鼠”（White Rats）的一员，这是贝克与杂耍艺人的第一个联盟，他与爸爸早在1901年就有过争执。六年后，当克劳和厄兰格与舒伯特夫妇合作，开始了“高级杂耍”巡回演出，与基斯巡回演出和贝克的奥芬剧院竞争时，爸爸与马丁·贝克之间的对立加剧了。尽管基斯、他的搭档阿尔比和贝克控制的经纪公司联合售票处威胁要将我们列入黑名单，但我们仍是新组合签约的众多艺人之一。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Like most vaudeville performers Pop disliked Martin Beck, who ran the Orpheum Circuit, which was the big-time circuit in Chicago and all points west. As a member of the White Rats, the vaudevillians' first union, which Beck fought bitterly, Pop and he had had words as early as 1901. The antagonism between the two increased a half dozen years later when Klaw and Erlanger in partnership with the Shuberts started an "advanced vaudeville" circuit, to compete with both the Keith Circuit and Beck's Orpheum string of theatres. We were among the many acts signed by the new group despite black-listing threats from the United Booking Office, the agents controlled by Keith, his partner Albee, and Beck.

　　不幸的是，新的冒险只持续了三个月。由于无法禁止所有逃兵，包括我们在内的许多众所周知的行为暂时得到了原谅。随着1914年欧洲战争的爆发，所有能够到达美国的外国人都涌向这里。他们很快被派上用场，尽可能多地取代美国的“不忠”行为。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Unfortunately the new venture lasted only three months. Unable to ban all of the deserters, many well-known acts, including ours, were forgiven—for the time being. With the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914 all foreign acts who could reach the United States rushed here. They were promptly put to work, replacing as many of the "disloyal" American acts as possible.

　　为了教导那些曾经叛逆的行为，他们使用“谁是老板”，杂耍巨头的UBO机构骚扰他们。他们制定了路线，这样这些叛逆行为不会在一夜之间从一个城市转到另一个城市。这迫使演员们在两次预订之间停演一整个星期，大大减少了他们的收入。关于演出的剧目会有无休止的争论。对像我们这样著名表演最严重的侮辱就是让它成为一场表演。这意味着在观众被炒热了气氛之前，而前面的一些人还坐在座位上。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
To teach those once rebellious acts that they were using who was boss, the vaudeville magnates' UBO agency harassed them in every way they could think of. They laid out routes so these acts could not make the trip from one city to another overnight. This forced the performers to lay off a whole week between bookings which cut down their income considerably. There would be endless arguments about material used. The worst insult to a well-known act like ours was making it open a show. This meant going on before the audience was warmed up and while some of the people out front were still being seated.

　　1916年我们在纽约皇宫剧院演出时，马丁·贝克（Martin Beck）对三基顿就是这么做的。当时纽约皇宫剧院已经取代了汉默斯坦的维多利亚成为了杂耍表演中最重要的舞台。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
This is what Martin Beck did to The Three Keatons in 1916 when we played the New York Palace which by then had replaced Hammerstein's Victoria as vaudeville's most important showcase. 
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　爸爸无法停止谈论这种暴行，他骂了贝克一遍又一遍。然后，在一个日场，当我们在演出的时候，爸爸看到了他的敌人，双臂交叉，怒视着他。“好吧，基顿，”马丁·贝克说，“让我笑吧！”爸爸的脸变紫了。我所知道的下一件事就是他朝着贝克飞奔而去，贝克转身跑出了舞台门。但老爹并不满足于把这位的大亨赶出剧院，他跟在气喘吁吁的贝克先生后面，贝克身高约5英尺8英寸，身材矮胖，从47街一直被追到第六大道，直到在人群中跟丢了贝克，爸爸才停下来。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop could not stop talking about this outrage. He called Beck every name in the book. Then, one matinee, when we were on, Pop looked out into the wings and saw his enemy, arms folded, glaring at him. "Okay, Keaton," said Martin Beck, "make me laugh!" Pop's face turned purple. The next thing I knew he was streaking toward Beck who turned and ran out the stage door. But Pop wasn't satisfied with chasing the two-a-day tycoon out of his own theatre. He followed the panting Mr. Beck—who was about five feet eight and chunky—up Forty-seventh Street and down Sixth Avenue, only stopping when he lost his man in the crowds.

　　与此同时，我一个人留在舞台上，不知道该怎么办。我唱着歌，背着诗，跳着舞，直到爸爸回来我们才能开始我们的表演。演出结束时，我们像往常一样得到了掌声。但那是三基顿最后一次在纽约或其他任何地方上演大型歌舞杂耍了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Meanwhile, left alone on the stage, I didn't know what to do. I sang a song, recited, jigged until Pop came back and we were able to go into our regular routine. At the finish we got our usual applause. But that was the last week The Three Keatons ever played big time vaudeville in New York—or anywhere else.
