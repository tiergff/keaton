　　我五岁的时候，爸爸让我成为我们表演的主角。在世纪之交，杂耍中还有许多其他受欢迎的家庭表演，但其中的儿童都没有出现在那之前。很多孩子都很有天赋，他们的父母和我一样渴望让他们在演艺圈拥有和我一样的优势。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop made me the featured performer of our act when I was five. There were dozens of other popular family acts in vaudeville at the turn of the century, but none of the children in them was featured as early as that. Many of those kids were very talented, and their parents were as eager as mine to give them the same headstart in show business that I was getting. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　老板们之所以同意让我出演，是因为我是独一无二的，在当时的歌舞杂耍中，我是唯一一个像哈克贝利·费恩（Huck Finn）那样调皮捣蛋的小男孩。其他人的父母则把他们的儿子打扮成可爱迷人的小公子（Little Lord Fauntleroys）。这些女孩都是“多莉酒窝”（Dolly Dimples）类型的，有着长长的金色卷发。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The reason managers approved of my being featured was because I was unique, being at that time the only little hell-raising Huck Finn type boy in vaudeville. The parents of the others presented their boys as cute and charming Little Lord Fauntleroys. The girls were Dolly Dimples types with long, golden curls. 
</font></details>

　　<font color=Orange>Huck Finn：出自马克·吐温创作的长篇小说《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》，是小说《汤姆·索亚历险记》的续集，首次出版于1884年。</font>

　　<font color=Orange>Little Lord Fauntleroy：儿童文学作家伯内特夫人的经典名作，写的是一个美国小男孩成为英国伯爵继承人的故事。本书于1886年出版。“Fauntleroy”从此成为英语词汇，指“过分盛装打扮的小孩”。</font>

　　在纽约、马萨诸塞和伊利诺斯等州，改革者们不知疲倦地努力阻止我们通过舞台走向地狱。我想他们是出于好意，但和其他许多真诚的善人一样，他们让人很头疼，尤其是对那些他们试图拯救的人来说。我怀疑没有哪个童星能比我们的Little Buster更努力地去救他。主要是因为我们轰轰烈烈的表演。即使是那些最喜欢我们作品的人，也对我能在和爸爸打打闹闹的过程中站起来感到惊讶。三基顿在大城市里总是比在小城市里更受欢迎，而且还有个令人讨厌的巧合，正是在这些大城市里，人们不遗余力地把我从舞台上“拯救”出来。我5岁在托尼帕斯特剧院出道的那天，纽约防止虐待儿童协会开始了宣传活动。纽约法律禁止7岁以下的儿童演员。仁慈的托尼帕斯特（Tony Pastor）解决了这个问题，他愉快地签署了一份宣誓书，发誓我已经七岁了。顺便说一句，在我们下一次在Pastors演出时，一个名叫伊兹·巴林（的瘦削东区年轻人在我们演出期间唱歌谣，每周可以得到五美元的报酬。当然，他就是那个后来改名为欧文·伯林（Irving Berlin）的伊兹·巴林。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Reformers in New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois, among other states, were tireless in their efforts to stop us all from going to hell via the stage. I guess they meant well, but like so many other sincere do-gooders they were a pain in the neck, particularly to those they were attempting to rescue. I doubt that any kid actor had more attempts made to save him than did our Little Buster. The reason, of course, was our slam-bang act. Even people who most enjoyed our work marveled that I was able to get up after my bashing, crashing, smashing sessions with Pop. The Three Keatons were always better received in the big cities than in the smaller ones, and by an annoying coincidence it was in these cities that the most persistent efforts were made to save me from the stage. The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children started its campaign the day I made my debut at five at Tony Pastor s Theatre. The New York law then barred child actors under seven years old. The benevolent Tony Pastor got around that problem by blithely signing an affidavit swearing I was already seven. Incidentally, at our next appearance at Pastors, a skinny East Side youth named Izzy Baline was paid five dollars a week to sing ballads from the gallery during our act. He was, of course, the same Izzy Baline who later changed his name to Irving Berlin.

　　当时被称为“格里协会”（Gerry Society）的S.P.C.C.没有被帕斯特的伪证证词唬住，指责父亲在台上虐待我。他们把这件事看得如此严重，以至于塔曼市市长R. A. Van Wyck（范威克），命令把我带到他的办公室脱光衣服，以便他亲眼看看我是否有瘀伤或青紫的痕迹。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Undiscouraged by Pastor's perjured affidavit the Gerry Society, as the S.P.C.C. was then called, accused my father of mistreating me on the stage. They made such an issue of it that Mayor R. A. Van Wyck, a Tammany man, ordered me brought to his office and stripped so he could see for himself if I had any bruises or black and blue marks. 
</font></details>

　　“为什么他像我的孩子一样没有受伤呢？”法官驳回了这些指控。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Why he is as free of hurt as one of my own boys," said his honor, dismissing the charges. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那年夏天，当我们被安排去康尼岛的越野障碍赛马乐园（Steeplechase Park）时，S.P.C.C.再次试图阻止我们工作。协会的负责人威尔逊断言，科尼岛不适合我这样一个年幼的孩子，因为那里到处都是扒手、妓女和其他流氓。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That summer the S.P.C.C. once more tried to stop me from working when we were booked into Steeplechase Park, Coney Island. The Society's Superintendent Wilson asserted that Coney Island was no place for a child of my tender years, because it was full of pickpockets, streetwalkers, and other riffraff. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　虽然这是事实，但市长对这些在选举日投票支持民主党、认为所有共和党人都疯了的部门的诽谤表示不满。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Though this was true, the Mayor resented these aspersions on a section that voted Democratic every Election Day and considered all Republicans demented. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“我经常在星期天骑自行车去科尼岛，”他说。“我在那里见过5万，甚至6万人，但从未注意到任何紊乱，那些人和富人一样有权娱乐，许可证被批准了。”“我也从未见过那里有任何混乱，”妈妈高兴地插话道。范威克（Van Wyck）市长转过身来，用猫头鹰般的目光瞪了她一眼。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"l have been to Coney Island frequently of a Sunday on my bicycle," he declared. "I have seen 50,000, even 60,000 people there and have never noticed any disorder. Those people are entitled to amusement as well as the rich. The permit is granted." "I have never seen any disorder there either," happily chimed in Mom. Mayor Van Wyck turned and gave her an owlish stare. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“夫人，”他说，“听我的劝告：你赢了一场官司时，不要再说别的了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Madam," he said, "take my advice: when you've won a case don't say another word." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　不气馁的儿童救助者继续他们的战斗。当改革派市长塞思·洛（Seth Low）接替范威克担任市长时，他们把我带到他面前，让我脱光衣服接受检查，还有一位纽约州州长，他们提高了年龄限制。但是我们的律师在法庭上击败了他们，他指出法律只禁止儿童表演走高钢丝或低钢丝、空中飞人、自行车等。但没有一个词能让我父亲把我当拖把展示在舞台上或踢我的脸是违法的。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The undiscouraged child-savers continued their battle. When Seth Low, a reform mayor, succeeded Van Wyck, they brought me before him to be stripped and examined, also before one New York governor. They had the age limit raised. But our lawyer beat them in court by pointing out that the law barred children only from performing on a high or low wire, a trapeze, bicycle, and the like. There was not one word that made it illegal for my father to display me on the stage as a human mop or to kick me in the face. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　最让我生气的是，当时有成千上万的无家可归、饥饿的被遗弃的孩子，他们和我一样大，在纽约的街道上游荡，卖报纸，擦皮鞋，在哈德逊河的渡船上拉小提琴，还有成千上万的孩子和父母一起在下东区的廉价血汗工厂工作。爸爸不明白为什么S.P.C.C.的人没有投入他们所有的时间、精力和金钱来帮助他们。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
What most burned up Pop was that there were then thousands of homeless and hungry abandoned children of my age wandering around the streets of New York, selling newspapers, shining shoes, playing the fiddle on the Hudson River ferryboats, and thousands of other small children working with their parents in the tenement sweatshops on the Lower East Side. Pop couldn't understand why the S.P.C.C. people didn't devote all of their time, energy, and money to helping them. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　一些剧院经理把我宣传成侏儒，以避免与“做好事”的人发生冲突，还让我父母把我打扮成侏儒。但爸爸想让所有的演出者，至少，意识到我是他的小男孩。他在戏剧行业报纸上登广告，说我不是侏儒，并谦虚地补充说，“而是对古怪少年天赋的揭示，正确地引导他们产生持久的喜剧效果，这是杂耍表演中最独特的角色，一个迷你喜剧演员，他表演了不可抗拒的喜剧，效果巨大，让女士们也站在一边。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Some theatre managers advertised me as a midget to avoid trouble with the do-gooders and got my parents to dress me as one. But Pop wanted to make sure that all show people, at least, realized I was his little boy. He put ads in the theatrical trade papers that said I was not a midget and added modestly, "but a revelation in eccentric juvenile talent, properly directed to produce the lasting comedy effects. The most unique character in vaudeville. A miniature comedian, who presents irresistible comedy, with gigantic effects, making the ladies hold their sides too." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　正如你所看到的，对于一个迷你喜剧演员来说，没有一个形容词——即使是巨大的形容词——对我的爸爸来说，也不足以让他从他的旧Blickenderfer打字机上摆脱出来，那是一台他随身带到全国各地的古董打字机。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
As you can see, no adjective—not even gigantic for a miniature comedian—was too much for my Pop to roll off his old Blickensderfer, the antique typewriter he hauled all over the country with him. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　与此同时，随着我年龄的增长，我们的行为变得越来越粗暴。一方面，我们从不费神连续两次做同样的动作。同时我们发现，通过任何疯狂的、野蛮的特技表演给对方一个惊喜要有趣得多。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Meanwhile, as I grew older, our act became progressively rougher. For one thing, we never bothered to do the same routines twice in a row. We found it much more fun to surprise one another by pulling any crazy, wild stunt that came into our heads. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　表演一开始，爸爸独自出来，宣布他要背诵。有时他说他会唱一首好听的歌。他刚开始看《莫德·穆勒》（Maud Muller）或《我流浪的男孩今晚在哪里》（Where Is My Wandering Boy Tonight）。当我上场，挑剔地从我们演出时用的那张破旧的餐桌上的十三四把旧扫帚中挑选一把。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The act started with Pop coming out alone and announcing that he would recite. Sometimes he said he would sing a beautiful song. He had hardly started on "Maud Muller" or "Where Is My Wandering Boy Tonight?" when I'd come out and fastidiously select one of the thirteen or fourteen old brooms that were on the end of the battered kitchen table we used in our act. 
</font></details>

  　　<font color=Orange>Maud Muller：约翰·格林利夫·惠蒂埃（John Greenleaf Whittier）在1854年写的诗歌，里面最出名的诗句：在一切言语或笔墨的哀伤中，最可悲的莫过于这句话了：“可能是这样的。”（Of all sad words of tongue and pen/ The saddest are these， ‘It might have been.’ ）
</font>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我不理睬他，便小心翼翼地扫掉桌子，然后装作看到了什么不存在的东西。我用手做杯状拿起这个想象中的物体，仔细看了看，然后把它放在桌子的另一边。这使爸爸心烦意乱。他停止了唱歌或背诵，把那个无形的东西移回到我拾起它的地方。我把它移到我想要的地方，他就把它移回来。随着我们的怒火不断高涨，我们开始疯狂地打斗，咆哮，拳打脚踢，在桌子对面和舞台上互相扔来扔去。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Ignoring him, I would carefully sweep off the table, then appear to see something that wasn't there. Picking up this imaginary object with my cupped hand, I examined it and then put it down on another part of the table. This distressed Pop. Stopping his singing or reciting, he moved the invisible thing back to the place where I'd picked it up. I'd move it to where I wanted it, he'd move it back. That went on with our rage mounting until we were fighting wildly, blasting, kicking, punching, and throwing one another across the table and all over the stage. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　但我们最受欢迎的格斗套路是，我用扫帚猛击他，而他的手从我额头上滑下来作为报复。一开始，我们互相取乐，轻敲几下。接着是更猛烈的打击，然后是我们全力以赴的重击。就在战斗进行到一半时，乐队指挥好像这一切从未发生过一样，站了起来，轻敲指挥棒，让乐队开始演奏“The Anvil Chorus”，我们互相击打以保持节奏。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
But our most popular fighting routine was one in which I whaled away at him with a broom while he retaliated by skidding his hand off my forehead. We started with tiny taps exchanged in fun. These were followed by harder blows, then slams to which we gave our all. In the middle of this fight the orchestra leader, reacting as though all this had never happened before, got to his feet, tapped his baton, and had the orchestra start playing "The Anvil Chorus," to which we kept time by hitting one another. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在另一个套路中，我们使用了室内布景。每个杂耍剧院也有一个通常代表农舍的房间。妈妈走到这前面，吹起了萨克斯风。她继续这样做，没有理会身后和周围爆发的混乱。当她继续演奏时，爸爸在屋子的角落里挂了一面镜子，在脸上涂上肥皂泡，然后开始用老式的刮胡刀刮胡子。我在镜子上方的钩子上系了一根又长又粗的橡胶绳，绳子连着一个篮球，我拿着绳子走到舞台的另一个角落。我每走一步，观众们都尖叫起来，以为橡胶绳会断，篮球撞到他的头。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
In another routine we used the house set. Every vaudeville theatre also had one of these which represented usually a room in a farmhouse. Mom came out in front of this and played the saxophone. She continued this, ignoring the chaos which erupted behind and all around her. As she played on, Pop hung a mirror on the corner of the house set, lathered his face, and started to shave himself with a straight, old-fashioned razor. I tied a long, thick rubber rope on a hook above the mirror. This was attached to a basketball which I carried to the opposite corner of the stage. With each step I took, the audience screamed, expecting the rubber rope to break and snap against his head. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当橡胶绳绷得很紧时，我才放开它。当爸爸用他那把老式的开放式剃刀刮喉咙时，篮球打在他的头上，把他那满是泡沫的脸撞到镜子上。在观众的尖叫声中，妈妈平静地继续吹她的萨克斯风。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When the rubber rope was stretched as tautly as possible, I let it go. As Pop was shaving his throat with his old-fashioned open razor, the basketball would sock him on the head and push his lathered face into the mirror. With the audience shrieking, Mom placidly continued playing her saxophone. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　1910年，澳大利亚水上运动明星安妮特·凯勒曼（Annette Kellerman）的连体泳衣引起了轰动，我们让妈妈在一件可以脱下的裙子里穿上了一件，她戴了一顶大帽子配这套衣服。最后，爸爸拉了一根绳子，脱下了裙子，留下妈妈穿的紧身泳衣，戴着一顶漂亮的大帽子，吹着萨克斯风。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
In 1910 when Annette Kellerman, the Australian aquatic star, created a sensation with her one-piece suit, we got Mom to put on one under a breakaway dress. She wore a big picture hat with the outfit. For a finish Pop pulled a string that stripped off the dress, leaving Mom playing the saxophone in a tight-fitting bathing suit and that large, dressy hat. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　不久就有了四个基顿，然后是五个。我的弟弟哈里·斯坦利·基顿（Harry Stanley Keaton），更广为人知的名字是Jingles，在我九岁时出生，两年后我的妹妹路易丝（Louise）出生。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Before long there were four Keatons. Then there were five. My brother, Harry Stanley Keaton, better known as Jingles, was born when I was nine, my sister Louise two years later. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　有一段时间，爸爸渴望能与“埃迪·福伊和七个小福伊（Eddie Foy and the Seven Little Foys.）”竞争。那场演出中最精彩的时刻是老埃迪（Eddie）走到脚灯前对观众说：“我花了很长时间才把这一幕演好。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
For a time Pop had wistful dreams of competing with "Eddie Foy and the Seven Little Foys." A great moment in that act was when Eddie, Sr., stepped to the footlights and confided to the audience: "It took me a long time to put this act together." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　一开始，爸爸试图把我们称为“四基顿”，但结果证明，我们的表演太出名了，所以没有改变我们的演员表，爸爸只好在旅馆登记表来满足自己。他用完了一整页，他是这样登记我们的：
</summary><font color=gray><br>
For a start Pop tried to bill us as "The Four Keatons," but we were too well known an act, it turned out, to change our billing. Pop had to satisfy himself with the billing he gave us on hotel registers. Using up an entire page, he checked us in this way: 
</font></details>

<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">

      Joe and Myra

      Buster

      Jingles

      Louise    

   <p>
      K<br />　E<br />　　A<br />　　　T<br />　　　　O<br />　　　　　N
    </p>
</div>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当然，他很快就把我的弟弟和妹妹都拉了进来。当Jingles出生一个星期的时候，爸爸用婴儿车把他推到舞台上。当这个年轻人能自己站起来的时候，爸爸就想办法用他来给我们的表演带来笑声。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
He had, of course, lost no time in getting both my little brother and sister into the act. When Jingles was only a week old Pop was wheeling him on stage in a baby buggy. As soon as the young man could stand up unassisted Pop figured out a way of using him for a laugh finish to our act. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他把Jingles放进我们穿的爱尔兰工人装里，然后为了我们的新衣服，他脱掉衣服，穿上他的Kellerman。作为一个真正的基顿，Jingles沉浸在掌声中。他甚至喜欢爸爸抓着他的腿倒过来，爸爸和我用他的腿，就像用一个棒球棒，用来选择到哪一边去玩一场球赛。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
He put Jingles into the same Irish workingmans outfit we were wearing, then for our new finish stripped him down to his Kellerman. Being a true Keaton, Jingles reveled in the applause. He even liked it when Pop held him by the leg upside down, and Pop and I used the leg as though it were a baseball bat on which to choose up sides for a scrub ball game. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当Jingles 13个月大的时候，爸爸在缅因州波特兰市基思剧院经纪人的默许下，做了一个假装绑架的特技，他希望这个特技能让我们在全国范围内得到宣传。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When Jingles was thirteen months old Pop, with the connivance of the press agent of the Keith Theatre, in Portland, Maine, pulled off a fake kidnaping stunt that he hoped would get us nation-wide publicity. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　情节很简单。他把Jingles放在婴儿车里，然后去了一家杂货店。然后，“绑架者”出现，一个另一场演出的道具员，被允许说几句话作为他的报酬的一部分，他坐上一辆租来的马车，把孩子从婴儿车里抱出来，急忙赶往波士顿和缅因火车站。有人给了道具员糖果，让Jingles安静下来。他的指示是把婴儿放在车站的长凳上，然后消失。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The plot was simple. He left Jingles on the street in his baby carriage while he went into a grocery store. Then "the kidnaper," a prop man who traveled with another act on the bill and was allowed to say a couple of lines as part of his pay, drove up in a hired carriage, snatched the child from its little buggy, and hurried to the Boston and Maine Railway Station. The prop man was given candy to keep Jingles quiet. His instructions were to leave the baby on a bench in the station and then disappear. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这些“阴谋家”犯了一个错误：没有在犯罪现场踩点。如果他们有去看，他们会带着他们的诡计去别的地方实施。因为在选定的那一天，杂货店前面那条街上有二十个意大利工人在翻挖路面，当时他们坐在路边吃午饭，抢孩子这时来了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The schemers made one mistake: not casing the scene of their crime. If they had they would have gone somewhere else with their shenanigans. For on the chosen day the street before the grocery was being ripped up by twenty Italian laborers, who were eating their lunch, sitting on the curb, when the snatch took place. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　他们看到绑架的人从马车上跳下来，抓住了Jingles，跳回车上，然后驾车离开。他们都是有家室的男人，结果被激怒了，一直追到波士顿和缅因火车站。当时道具员吓得不知所措，他急忙放下Jingles，向男厕跑去。大概是他爬出了窗户，躲过了意大利挖沟工人的愤怒。我这么说大概是因为这个不幸的人再也没有出现过，显然，他完全被吓坏了，甚至没有回到剧院拿他的薪水。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
They saw the prop man-kidnaper jump from the carriage, grab Jingles, jump back, and drive off. Family men all, they were outraged and pursued him down to the B. and M. Station. By that time the prop man was scared witless. He hastily put down Jingles, and then streaked for the men s room. From this he presumably escaped the wrath of the Italian ditchdiggers by climbing out of the window. I say presumably, because the unfortunate man was never seen again. Apparently, he was completely intimidated, for he did not even come back to the theatre to get his pay. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　妈妈在露易丝出生前不久就退出了。有一段时间，爸爸曾想过继续在杂耍表演中扮演“基顿三人组”的角色，让Jingles担任三人组的第三名成员。但有人说服了爸爸，在妈妈不在场的情况下，经理们会讨厌把孩子蒙在鼓里。当我建议他和我一起工作时，他说，“但不是三基顿了，对吧？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Mom quit the act shortly before Louise was born. For a while Pop toyed with the idea of continuing in vaudeville anyway as The Three Keatons, using Jingles as the third member of the trio. But someone convinced him that managers would resent having a baby palmed off on them during Mom's absence from the act. When I suggested that he and I could work together, he said, "But it wouldn't be The Three Keatons, would it?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　最后，他决定让我们成为大多数巡回演出公司雇佣的在演出间隙或常规演出结束后出现的“特别安排节目（special added attraction）”。等妈妈恢复到可以和我们一起演出时，我们就回去杂耍，过完这一季剩下的时间。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
In the end he decided that we'd become the "special added attraction" that most touring stock companies hired to appear between acts or after the regular show. When Mom got strong enough to join us we'd go back into vaudeville for the rest of the season. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　经过一番讨价还价，爸爸与芬伯格股票公司（Fenberg Stock Company）达成了交易，该公司在新英格兰巡演，发行《小心男人！》《勇敢的报童》《女人的力量》等情节剧。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After much dickering, Pop made a deal with the Fenberg Stock Company which traveled through New England offering such sturdy melodramas as Beware of Men!, Grit, the Newsboy, and In a Woman's Power. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　与芬伯格的团队合作有一件令人不安的事。芬伯格先生坚持让我们在他当晚演出的最后一幕之间上演。当这部剧是《勇敢的报童》时，这并不算太糟糕，但当它是一部感人泪下的剧时，很多观众先是同情地哭，然后笑几分钟我们粗野的胡闹，再回到剧中最后一幕眼泪汪汪的戏。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
There was one disturbing thing about working with the Fenberg outfit. Mr. Fenberg insisted on putting us on between the last acts of whatever play he was doing that evening. This wasn't too bad when the show was Grit, the Newsboy, but when it was one of the tear-jerking operas it was asking an awful lot of an audience to cry compassionately one moment, laugh at our roughhouse capers for a few minutes, then go back to its crying during the last weepy act of the play. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在我们和那个剧团一起演出的十七八周的某个时候，爸爸突然想到，我除了充当人体投射物的工作之外，也应该在戏剧方面有个演出机会。他觉得这段经历会帮助我成为一个全面的表演者。没费什么劲，芬伯格先生被说服了，就在他的剧团的剧目中增加几出适合我的好角色。他选择的是小爵爷方特勒罗伊（Little Lord Fauntleroy）和东林恩（East Lynne）。我将在小爵爷方特勒罗伊里演主要角色，在东林恩中扮演“小威廉”。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Sometime during the seventeen or eighteen weeks we played with that troupe Pop got the notion that I should be given a whack at dramatic work in addition to my job as a human projectile. He felt the experience would help me become an all-around performer. With little difficulty Mr. Fenberg was talked into the idea of adding a couple of plays to his company's repertory that had good parts for me. His choices, of all things, were Little Lord Fauntleroy and East Lynne. I was to play the title role of Fauntleroy and "Little William" in East Lynne. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当我们拿到《小爵爷方特勒罗伊》的剧本时，我们发现这个角色有七十五个台词表，这使它成为英文戏剧中除哈姆雷特以外最长的角色。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When we got the script for Little Lord Fauntleroy we discovered the part had seventy-five sides, which made it the longest role, except Hamlet, in the English-speaking theatre. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在学会了所有台词后，演“小威廉”似乎还行。不过这里也有一个困难，因为芬伯格先生在最后两幕之间安排着我们的节目。“小威廉”要在《东林恩》的第四幕结束时去世，这意味着我只能穿着我的巴掌鞋和滑稽的爱尔兰人服装，然后上床去死。幕布一落地，我就跳了起来，擦了擦像垂死男孩的白色粉末，赶紧戴上吓人的假发和胡须，和爸爸一起跑上舞台。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After learning all of those lines, doing "Little William" seemed just a bit. There was a difficulty here also though, because of Mr. Fenberg's spotting us between the two last acts of the show. This because "Little William" dies at the end of the fourth act of East Lynne. That meant I had to put on my slap shoes and my comic Irishmans costume before getting into bed to die. The moment the curtain hit the floor I leaped up, wiped off the white powder suitable to a dying boy, hurriedly put on my fright wig and whiskers and raced on stage with Pop.

　　一切都很顺利，直到一位情绪激动的女演员被雇来扮演我在东林恩剧里的母亲。为了比莎拉·伯恩哈特（Sarah Bernhardt）更出色，她用她所有的一切，包括她的胳膊肘，在我去世的那场戏。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Everything worked out well enough until a highly emotional actress was hired to play my mother in East Lynne. Determined to outshine Sarah Bernhardt she played the scene where I die with everything she had, including her elbows. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　剧本要求她在我去世时倒在我的床上。但她被激动冲昏了头脑，两只胳膊肘重重地压在我的肚子上，这让死去的“小威廉”死而复生。他痛得嚎叫着，双脚向上抬起，露出了他穿着巴掌鞋和宽松裤子。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The script called for her to fall on my bed just as I passed away. But swept away with emotion she landed square on my stomach with both elbows. That brought dead "Little William" back to life violently. Howling with pain, his feet went up, exposing the fact that he was wearing slap shoes and baggy pants as he passed on. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　观众们一直在哭，后来又笑得歇斯底里。在我们整个表演过程中，在剧的最后一幕——可怜的伯恩哈德自己死亡的一幕——他们仍在笑这件荒唐的事。当最后的帷幕落下时，他们还在控制不住地笑。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The audience, crying until then, became hysterical with laughter. They laughed at the grotesque incident all through our act, and through the play's final act in which the poor Bernhardt had her own death scene. They were still laughing, uncontrollably, when the final curtain came down. 
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　只要他能搞定，爸爸就让露易丝和我们一起表演。让她穿上能分离的裙子和凯勒曼泳衣。我猜当他在节目中给她一句台词时，她刚刚学会说话。那个星期，我们和百老汇日场偶像罗伯特·希利亚德（Robert Hilliard）在同一个节目上演出，他的一个短剧里有一个副警长不停地喃喃自语，“法律的法律！”好像这就是一切的答案。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
As soon as he could manage it Pop had Louise in the act with the rest of us. He put her in the breakaway dress and the Kellerman. I guess she had just learned to talk when he gave her a line in the show. We were playing that week on the same bill with Robert Hilliard, the Broadway matinee idol, who had a sketch in which a deputy sheriff repeatedly muttered, "Law's Law!" as though that were the answer to everything. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　爸爸觉得如果露易丝在我们的表演中重复这句台词会很可爱。但在一个日场上，&nbsp;Jingles抢先说：“法律的法律！”在她张嘴之前。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Pop thought it would be cute if Louise repeated this line in our act. But at one matinee Jingles beat her to it and said, "Law's Law!" before she could get her mouth open. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这时，露易丝挣脱过来，打在Jingles的脸上使他哭了起来。当爸爸用衬衫一角擦Jingles的脸时，他在舞台上低声对观众说：“我们家都等不及到更衣室解决他们的争吵了。”和前面的人怒吼。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Thereupon Louise, a girl of spirit, hauled off and hit Jingles in the face, causing him to burst into tears. As Pop wiped off Jingles's face with a corner of his shirt, he told the audience in a stage whisper, "This family doesn't wait to get to the dressing room to settle their quarrels." And the folks out front roared. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　妈妈负责双重任务，照顾Jingles和妹妹，我在阳光明媚的早晨带孩子们出去玩一两个小时，尽可能地帮忙，有一天我们在基思的波士顿演出时我就这样做的。当时Jingles五岁，露易丝三岁，由于当地法律的原因，两人都不能参加演出。但我们把他们带到了剧院。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
With Mom doing double duty, taking care of little Jingles and Sis, I helped when I could by taking the children out for an hour or two on sunny mornings. I did that one day when we were playing at Keith's Boston. Jingles was then five, Louise three, and neither could work in the act because of the local laws. But we brought them to the theatre. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这一天，我带他们到公共场所，让他们坐在长凳上，给他们买了几袋花生，这样他们就可以喂鸽子了。附近有很多东西吸引着一个14岁的男孩，包括糖果店的橱窗和消防站，在那里你可以看到马厩里的马，等待着在锣响时冲出。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
This day I took them to the Common where I sat them on a bench and bought them bags of peanuts so they could feed the pigeons. There were a great many things nearby to fascinate a fourteen-year-old boy, including the show windows of a candy store and a firehouse where you could see the horses in their stalls, waiting to dash out when the gong rang. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　突然，我注意到一群人站在一辆警车周围。马车驶去时，我看到了Jingles的头和小红帽，我一路追到警察局。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Suddenly I noticed a crowd of people standing around a police wagon. As the wagon started I saw Jingles's head and little red cap inside. I ran after it all the way to the police station. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　就在我喊Jingles的时候，一个警察走了进来，拉着Louise的手。“又一个迷路的孩子。”他告诉接待的警官。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
As I was claiming Jingles, a policeman walked in, holding Louise by the hand. "Here's another lost kid," he told the desk sergeant. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“那是我妹妹，露易丝，”我解释道。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"That's my sister, Louise," I explained. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“哦，是吗？”警官问。“你先是失去了哥哥，然后又失去了妹妹。现在，你还剩下一些散落在城里的还在，让我那些已经超负荷工作的手下送来吗？”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Oh, it is, is it?" asked the desk sergeant. "First you lose your brother, then you lose your sister. Now, are there any more little ones that you have left scattered around the city to be brought in by my already overworked men?" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“不，先生，”我说。然后我瞥了一眼手表，吹了声口哨。“我有麻烦了，”我告诉接待警官。“我们有场日场演出要去基思剧院看，但我没能及时赶到。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"No, sir," I said. Then I glanced at my watch and whistled. "I'm in trouble," I told the desk sergeant. "I have a matinee to do at Keith's theatre, and 111 never get there in time." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那个警官是个好心人。他让警车送我们去剧院，正好赶上看演出。几年后，许多州都通过了禁止未成年人登台表演的法律，爸爸完全放弃了让Louise和Jingles参与表演的想法。我们把他们送进了密歇根州马斯基根附近的好学校，有几年我们在那里避暑。Louise和Jingles都愤怒地抗议，但我的父母很坚决，爸爸看到他想超越埃迪·福伊的家庭表演的希望都破灭了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That police sergeant was a goodhearted man. He had his police wagon rush us to the theatre just in time for the show. A few years later so many states had passed laws against stage appearances by minors that Pop entirely gave up the idea of using Louise and Jingles in the act. We put them into good schools near Muskegon, Michigan, where for some years we'd had our summer home. Both protested furiously, but my parents were firm, and Pop saw whatever hope he had of outdoing Eddie Foy's family act die right there. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我一生中最美好的夏天是1908年爸爸在马斯基根湖边建的小屋里度过的。这是在布拉夫顿，一个位于悬崖上的夏季殖民地，就在马斯基根湖对面，位于马斯基根湖和密歇根湖之间一英里宽的沙地上。我们的房子很小，没有现代化的管道，甚至没有中世纪的管道。但这房子对我们来说正合适，有三个卧室，厨房里有一个煤气炉，妈妈就是用它来学习做饭的。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The best summers of my life were spent in the cottage Pop had built on Lake Muskegon in 1908. This was in Bluffton, a summer colony on a bluff just across Lake Muskegon from the town and located on a mile-wide strip of sandy land between that lake and Lake Michigan. Ours was a small place without modern plumbing, or even medieval plumbing. But it was just right for us, had three bedrooms, and in the kitchen the gasoline stove on which Mom learned to cook. 
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　看到俄克拉荷马州的房价飙升，波普确信房地产是一种安全的投资。尽管之前在德克萨斯州加尔维斯顿购买了五处滨水地皮。这五个地皮很快就被废弃了，因为市政府决定在它们之间修建一道海堤。市政府只付给爸爸房产价格的一小部分，但当他抱怨时，有人告诉他这是宝贵的教训，教他在未来进行更明智的投资。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Having seen values skyrocket in the Oklahoma territory, Pop was convinced that real estate was the one safe investment. This despite a previous purchase of five water-front lots in Galveston, Texas. These five lots were condemned soon afterward when the city fathers decided to build a sea wall across them. The city paid Pop only a fraction of what the property cost, but when he complained he was told that it was a valuable lesson to him and should teach him to make more intelligent investments in the future. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　布拉夫顿对我们来说是完美的，还有另外一个原因：大约有18到20个杂耍演员和他们的家人住在那里。这意味着妈妈可以随心所欲地玩纸牌，而爸爸也不会找不到可以交换故事的同伴。帕斯科酒馆里有一个酒吧，所有的演员都是这个俱乐部的会员。至于我和年幼的孩子们，我们每天早上起床时就穿上泳衣，直到睡觉时才脱下来。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Bluffton was perfect for us for another reason: there were about eighteen or twenty vaudeville actors living there with their families. That meant Mom could play all the pinochle her heart craved and Pop would not run out of fellow performers to swap yarns with. There was a bar in Pasco's Tavern and a club to which all the actors belonged. As for me and the younger children, we just got into bathing suits each morning on getting up and never took them off until we went to bed. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　布拉夫顿俱乐部的成员们把竹竿放在可以俯瞰湖泊的俱乐部门廊的支柱上。钓线上有一个漂浮的软木塞，新来的人一走出来欣赏湖对岸的风景时，软木塞就亲切地上下浮动。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The Bluffton Club members had a bamboo fishing pole set in a prop on the clubhouse porch which overlooked the lake. On its line was a floating cork which obligingly bobbed the moment a newcomer stepped out there to admire the view across the lake. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当游客把鱼竿从吊架上拿下来时，他会猛地一甩，开始了他一生中最激烈的钓鱼大战。与此同时，他的喊叫和与他一起站在走廊上的人的喊叫引起了附近房子里人们的注意。他们会拿着鱼叉和大大小小的渔网跑上来。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When the visitor took the pole off its cradle, he would give it a jerk, starting what proved to be the fish-fighting battle of his life. Meanwhile, his cries and those of the people on the porch with him had attracted the attention of the people in the nearby houses. They would run up with gaffs and small and large fish nets. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“把他甩到左边！”他们会欢呼鼓励，同时：“放线！”“天呐！别让那个大家伙跑了。你永远也不会原谅自己！”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Jerk him to the left!" they would cry encouragingly; also, "Let out your line!" and "My God! Don't let this big fellow get away. You'll never forgive yourself!" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当游客马上歇斯底里或筋疲力尽时，这条鱼会潜入5英尺深的地方，然后倒转身子，再浮上来，从来没有鱼这样游过。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When the visitor neared hysteria or exhaustion the fish would dive five feet down, then reverse itself and come back up, as no fish had ever done. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　这通常是活跃的渔夫得到的第一个暗示，可能哪里不对劲。在适当的时候，他身后的房间里会有人说：“看在迈克的份上，你能不能放开那根杆子，让我把这东西绑好！”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
That was usually the first hint the buoyant fisherman got that something might be amiss. At the proper moment someone in the room behind him would say, "For the love of Mike will you let go of that pole so I can tie off this thing!" 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　客人把杆子放回后会向他解释这个花招。软木塞上的绳子穿过一个滑轮，滑轮被一块大石头压着，绳子从那里穿过俱乐部下面的一个小洞，再向上穿过俱乐部主房间的一个小洞。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After the guest put back the pole in the cradle, the gimmick would be explained to him. The line from the bobbing cork went through a pulley weighted down by a big rock, from there under the clubhouse and up through a small hole in the main room of the club. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们用这种花招愚弄了许多滑稽的人，包括伯纳德·格兰维尔、哈利·福克斯和弗兰克·廷尼，许多戏剧界人士认为他是那个时代最伟大的天生的喜剧演员。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We fooled a lot of funny men with that gimmick, including Bernard Granville, Harry Fox, and Frank Tinney, whom many theatrical people considered the greatest natural comedian of his day. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我偶尔试着为布拉夫顿的游客们带来一些刺激。如果我骑着自行车路过，看到不认识的人坐在俱乐部的门廊上，我会沿着码头，骑着自行车和所有东西，掉进水里。如果陌生人划船经过我们的房子，他们有时会看到一些令他们瞠目的东西。房子下面有一座软和的沙子山，倾斜到水边有二三十英尺。从船上往上看，陌生人会看到锅碗瓢盆被扔出门廊，然后是两个孩子，Jingles 和Louise。在他们从震惊中恢复之前，我自己会飞奔而出，走到屋后开始起跑，这样我能腾空而起，然后头朝下，四肢着地。当然，那些无辜的旁观者不可能知道，当我们着陆时，山上的沙子太软了，不会伤害到孩子们和我自己。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I tried occasionally to contribute a thrill for visitors to Bluffton. If I saw anyone I didn't know sitting on the clubhouse porch while I was riding by on my bicycle I would race down the dock there and go off, bicycle and all, into the water. If strangers rowed past our house they sometimes saw something that made their eyes pop. Below the house there was a hill of soft sand which slanted down for twenty or thirty feet to the edge of the water. Looking up from their boat, the strangers would see pots and dishpans being thrown off the porch, then the two children, Jingles and Louise. Before they got over the shock, I myself would come flying out. By going to the back of the house I'd get a running start that enabled me to leap high in the air and come down headfirst, landing on all fours. The innocent observers had no way of knowing, of course, that the sand on that hill was too soft to hurt either the kids or myself when we landed. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　不管怎么说，那时他们正疯狂地划船到最近的房子，急切地想找到一部电话，然后通知警察，有个疯子刚刚把厨房用具和两个孩子从他家的门廊上扔了下去，然后自己也纵身一跃。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
By that time, anyway, they were rowing madly to the nearest house, eager to locate a telephone and notify the police that some madman had just thrown kitchen utensils and two children off his porch, and then had leaped to destruction himself.

　　像许多其他的美国男孩一样，我也有“机械倾向”。我花了很多时间修修补补，打磨阀门，拆了又装，把我们的汽车和爸爸买的25英尺长的游艇发动机拆开再重新组装起来，这艘游艇的名字叫战舰（Battleship）。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Like so many other American boys I was "mechanically inclined." I spent a lot of my time tinkering, grinding the valves, taking apart and putting together again the motors of our car and the 25-foot cruiser boat Pop bought and modestly named Battleship.

　　我喜欢埃德·格雷，所以我设计了几种设备，让他不必再动弹了。他说，他一生最艰难的考验之一，就是不得不在半夜下雨时起床把窗户关上。当我为他设计了一个不用离开床就能打开关上卧室窗户的装置时，他非常感激。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
I liked Ed Gray and worked on several devices to save him the agony of having to stir. One of the worst trials of his life, he said, was having to get up in the middle of the night to close the window when it rained. He was most grateful when I rigged up a contrivance that enabled him to close or open the bedroom window without leaving his bed. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　埃德家里只有一只钟，没有手表。他抱怨说，每次走进另一个房间，他都必须改变大厅壁炉架上的钟的位置。当我为那只钟配了一个带有绳子的转盘时，他感激不尽。只要一拉绳子，就可以把钟转向他所在的房间。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Ed had only one clock in the house and no watch. But he complained that he had to change the position of the clock on the mantel in the hall each time he went into another room. He couldn't thank me enough when I rigged up a turntable for the clock with strings attached. By pulling one of the strings he could turn its face to whichever room in the house he was in.

　　当被追问时，埃德·格雷说这个问题与他的户外小屋有关，他的小屋坐落在一座小山的山顶上，可以俯瞰这两个美丽的湖泊。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
On being pressed, Ed Gray said the problem concerned his outhouse which sat on the top of a hill commanding a view of both beautiful lakes. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　来附近野餐的人，无论是想在乡间度过一个下午，还是想摘沙土上的野葡萄和浆果，都会去他的户外小屋。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Picnickers who came to the vicinity either for an afternoon in the country or to pick the wild grapes and berries which grew in the sandy soil in profusion were forever using his outhouse. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“而且是在最不方便的时候，”他说。“警告牌上写着‘私人’或‘私人小屋’、‘小心蚊虫！’和‘小心！拉格尔的巨型斗牛犬’都没有阻止这些——我该说是——擅自占用者。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"And at the most inconvenient times,'' he said. "Warnings on signs reading 'Private' or 'Personal Outhouse,' Watch Out for Gnats I' and 'Beware! Giant Bulldog at Largel' have not stopped these—shall I say—squatters." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　为了阻止这种滥用，我买了一些弹簧铰链，把他的外屋的四壁切割成独立的嵌板。我还把屋顶切成两半，分别钉在墙壁两侧。我在小屋下面放了一根长管子，并系了一个螺栓。我从门闩上拉了一根线到艾德的厨房窗户，在上面挂了一些红色的法兰绒内衣和旧衬衫，让它看起来像一根晾衣绳。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
To stop this abuse of his facilities I bought some spring hinges and cut his outhouse's four walls into separate panels. I also cut the roof of this refuge into two, and nailed each half to opposite sides of the outhouse. I put a long pipe under the outhouse and attached a bolt. From the bolt I ran a line to Ed's kitchen window, hanging on it some red flannel underwear and old shirts to make it look like a clothesline. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　做完这一切后，埃德只需坐在窗边等着。如果有任何闯入者——不管是陌生人还是朋友——胆敢使用他的户外小屋，埃德就会猛拉晾衣绳，导致户外小屋的四面和屋顶都向外倒塌。这个无助的入侵者被发现时，他的姿势和惠斯勒的母亲（Whistler&#8217;s Mother）一样，只是坐在了一个不那么高贵的栖木上。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
With all of that done Ed merely had to sit by a window and wait. If any trespasser—stranger or friend—had the audacity to use his outhouse, Ed jerked the clothesline causing all four sides of the outhouse and the roof of it to fall outward. The helpless intruder was then revealed in the same position as Whistler's Mother but sitting on a less dignified perch.

　　每当像我们这样的标准表演在冬天有几个星期的空闲时间时，我们会搬到纽约，通常是搬到当时西38街两旁的一家剧院寄宿处。这些剧院离美国最伟大的表演者在百老汇的办公室和杂耍演员渴望观看的新演出所在的剧院都不远。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Whenever a standard act like ours had a few free weeks during the winter it moved to New York, generally to one of the theatrical boardinghouses that lined West 38th Street in those days. These were within walking distance of both the Broadway offices of America's greatest showmen and of the theatres housing the new shows which the vaudevillians were eager to see. 
</font></details>

　　那条街上有很多不错的寄宿公寓，但我们最喜欢的还是一个德国家庭经营的埃里克公寓。食物很好，气氛友好，房间又大又舒适，还有很多的存储空间，以防你在路上想要丢下几个箱子。当然，在其他大城市里也有很好的寄宿处。我最喜欢的两家是费城的泽泽家和巴尔的摩的霍华德母亲家。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
There were a lot of good boardinghouses on that street, but our favorite was the Ehric House which was run by a German family. The food was good, the atmosphere was friendly, the rooms were large and comfortable, with lots of storage space in case you wanted to leave a couple of trunks behind while you went on the road. There were good boardinghouses for actors, of course, in the other big cities. Two I remember with particular fondness are Zeiser's in Philadelphia and Mother Howard's in Baltimore.

　　在一个寒冷的夜晚，埃里克发生一系列灾难，包括火灾、火车失事和其他事故，开始危及我们困惑而无辜的基顿生命和财产。气温在零下一度，外面的街道上覆盖着冰雪，地窖里起了火。那天早上两点钟，房子的地板上开始冒出滚滚浓烟。我们在二楼后面有一个大房间，当我们醒来时，烟太浓了，我们甚至没有时间穿衣服。“你父亲在哪里？”妈妈问。我知道他在第八大道和第三十八街拐角处的酒吧里，但我只是耸了耸肩，因为我知道如果告诉她了，她会说什么。没时间穿衣服了，所以我抓去&nbsp;Jingles，妈妈抓起妹妹。我们设法和其他寄宿的一起安全到街上。邻居们收留了我们，用毯子把我们包起来，还给我们送来咖啡。妈妈和孩子们被照顾好，我就跑到街角的酒馆告诉爸爸火灾的事。他看到了救火车，但不知道埃里克家是他们的目的地。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
It was in Ehric's on a freezing night that a long series of disasters, including fires, train wrecks, and other accidents began to imperil the lives and property of us bewildered and innocent Keatons. With the temperature one below zero and the streets outside covered with ice and snow a fire started in the cellar. At two o'clock that morning smoke started billowing up through the floors of the house. We had a large room on the second floor rear, but the smoke was so thick by the time we were awakened that we didn't even have time to dress. "Where's your father?" asked Mom. I knew he was at the saloon at the corner of Eighth Avenue and 38th Street, but I just shrugged, knowing what she'd say if I told her. There was no time to dress, so I grabbed Jingles and Mom grabbed Sis. We managed to make our way safely to the street with the other boarders. The neighbors took in all of us, wrapped us in blankets, and gave us coffee. As soon as Mom and the kids were taken care of, I tore down to the corner saloon to tell Pop about the fire. He had seen the engines but didn't know the Ehric House was their destination.

</summary><font color=gray><br>
Shouting to the bartender to wrap me in warm clothing, he rushed out. As it turned out we had lost nothing. Thanks to the firemen the flames never reached above the ground floor. The dining room furniture was destroyed, and Mrs. Ehric's silverware, stored in the top drawer of the bureau, had melted into one vast lump of metal.

That summer we were in two more boardinghouse fires. One was at the Canobie Lake Hotel, near Salem, New Hampshire. The theatre was close to the hotel, and when Pop heard the fire engines he raced straight to the hotel and up two nights of stairs. He managed to gather up the clothes and get them into wardrobe trunks which he threw down the stairs. Our losses were small compared to those of the other actors living at the hotel.

　　后来，他向我和妈妈解释他打算如何对付烟雾、火灾和火焰。无论我们住在哪里，房间里的桌子上总是挂着一条围巾（他指出）。他会捡起这个东西的四个末端，以及书桌上的所有东西，然后把它们都倒在床上。接着，他会把衣柜抽屉里的所有东西都扔到床上。最后，他会走进浴室，用一条大土耳其毛巾把所有东西都收拾起来，然后把它们也放在床上。

Later he explained to Mom and me how he planned to cope with smoke, fire, and flame. A scarf (he pointed out) was always on the bureau in the rooms wherever we stayed. He would pick up the four ends of this and everything on the bureau top and dump it all on the bed. Next he would throw everything in the bureau drawers on the bed. Finally, he would go into the bathroom, gather up eveiything there in a large Turkish towel and get that stuff on the bed.

　　然后他要做的就是把这些东西捆起来扔出窗外。“之后，”他得意地总结道，“我将扔掉我们的箱子和其他行李。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
All he then would have to do was tie up all of this and throw it out of the window. "After that," he concluded triumphantly, "I will throw out our trunks and other luggage."

　　在我们遇到下一次火灾时，这方法非常好——除了一些细节。这场火灾发生在那年夏天晚些时候，在俄亥俄州托莱多郊外的湖边酒店。其中一个细节是墨水瓶，他被这个墨水瓶施了魔法。他把它从壁炉架上拿起来，像拿宝石一样拿着，把它放在桌子上，又拿起来，又放到桌上。他第三次拿起它，把它扔出窗外，打破了魔咒。第二个细节是他忘记了装衣服的衣橱是可拆卸的。当爸爸奋力冲进衣柜时，他猛地一挥，希望能一下子把所有的衣服都抓出来。除了一个衣架，他把所有衣架都取了下来。他看不清自己在做什么，便猛地一拽。唯一的衣架仍然挂在钩子上，结果他把整个衣柜拖了下来，压在自己身上。

At our next fire it worked splendidly—except for a couple of details. This fire occurred later that summer at the Lake Hotel, just outside of Toledo, Ohio. One detail was an ink bottle which turned out to have him bewitched. He picked it up from the mantel and, handling it as though it were a gem, put it down on a table, picked it up, put it down on the bureau. The third time he picked it up he threw it out of the window and broke the spell. The second detail was his forgetting that the wardrobe containing our clothes was detachable. When Pop fought his way to the wardrobe he made a wild swipe, hoping to grab all of the clothes with that one swing. He managed to disengage every hanger but one. Unable to see what he was doing, he yanked away. The one hanger remained caught on the hook with the result that he dragged down the whole wardrobe on top of himself.

　　然后他不得不奋力挣脱出来，以及所有衣服。烟越来越浓，每分钟都让他更加窒息，爸爸设法把衣服扔出窗外，冲下楼，和我们一起在草坪上。但他说：“该死，我忘带打字机了。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Then he had to fight his way out of that and all of the clothes as well. With the smoke thickening and choking him more by the minute, Pop managed to throw the clothes out of the window, dashed downstairs, and joined us on the lawn. But when he did he said, "Damn it, I forgot my typewriter." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　尽管烟比刚才更浓了，爸爸还是冲进了燃烧的旅馆，拿起了打字机。但由于浓烟，他不能直走，也不能弯腰，甚至不能跳哥萨克舞（Russian Kazatsky）。他一只手拖着他那台珍贵的打字机走了出来，鼻子离地只有一英寸。这一次，当他走出大楼时，二楼砰的一声倒塌了。如果爸爸再耽搁一会儿，他就死了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Though the smoke was thicker than before Pop dashed back into the burning hotel and picked up the typewriter. But he couldn't walk straight because of the dense smoke, he couldn't bend down or even do a Russian Kazatsky. He came out dragging his precious typewriter with one hand and with his nose an inch from the floor. As he got out of the building this time the second floor collapsed with a terrible crash. Pop would have been killed if he had delayed a moment longer.

<font color=Orange>　　Russian Kazatsky：应该是指哥萨克舞（kazotsky kick）。

　　那年秋天，我们离开马斯基根两周后，在爱荷华州的苏城演出，这种情况又发生了。这次我们的房间在三楼。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Two weeks after leaving Muskegon that fall it happened again, while we were playing Sioux City, Iowa. Our room this time was on the third floor. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　火灾发生的时候，妈妈正在洗澡，爸爸在邮局取我们的邮件。他当他看到红色的消防车从他身边疾驰而过赶往现场，他立刻知道了火灾。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When that fire broke out, Mom was taking a bath and Pop was down at the post office getting our mail. The first he knew about a blaze was when he saw the red fire engines racing past him on their way to the scene. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“我敢打赌，一定是那个该死的旅馆，”他没有特别对谁喊。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I bet it's the damned hotel," he yelled to nobody in particular. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　是的。每个人都像往常一样。我抓住妹妹，妈妈从浴缸里爬出来，抓住了Jingles。消防员们刚把梯子架到旅馆一楼商店的屋顶上，但是爸爸在他们前面爬上了梯子，而消防员则对他大喊大叫。他及时赶到房间，收拾好我们的东西扔出窗外，把所有东西都保存了下来。那是最后一次火灾。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
It was. Everybody did the usual. I grabbed Sis, and Mom climbed out of the bathtub and got Jingles. The firemen had just put up their ladders to the roof of the store on the hotel's ground floor, but Pop clambered up one of these ahead of them while they yelled their brains out at him. He got to the room in time, gathered up our stuff and threw it out of the window and saved everything. That was the last of the fires. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　但从同一季开始，我们开始卷入火车失事事件。第一次发生在我们从纽约州奥尔巴尼开往宾夕法尼亚州斯克兰顿的列车上。我们坐在可翻转的座位上，只有Jingles躺在座位上睡着了。妈妈，露易丝和我坐在另一个座位上。爸爸像往常一样坐在冒烟的车厢里，愉快地谈论着基顿家的五个人。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
But beginning with that same season we started getting involved with train wrecks. Our first one occurred while we were traveling on a Lehigh Valley train from Albany, New York, to Scranton, Pennsylvania. We were sitting in reversible seats except for Jingles who was lying asleep on a seat. Mom, Louise, and I were on the other seat. Pop, as usual, was in the smoking car gabbing happily away about the five Keatons. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　突然传来一阵震动和震耳欲聋的撞击声。这列火车撞上了一列货运列车，出轨了两节车厢，并爬到了货运列车的车尾。Jingles被震到了另一个座位上，就在座椅靠背倒转的时候飞过了过道。他在移动的椅背下滚来滚去，根本没人碰他。他甚至没有醒来，因此赢得了无可争议的称号，成为所有基顿家族中的睡眠冠军。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Suddenly, there was a jolt and an ear-splitting crash. The train had plowed right into a freight train, derailed two cars, and climbed on top of the freight train's caboose. Jingles was jarred right over to the other seat, flying across the aisle just as the seat backs reversed. He rolled under the moving seat backs without even being touched. He did not even wake up, thus winning the undisputed title as the sleeping champion of all the Keatons. 
</font></details>

<details><summary>
　　第二年春天，我们在去弗吉尼亚州诺福克的路上，翻越了蓝岭山脉。雨下了三天。我们在一座山的一侧，一边是200英尺的落差，另一边是高耸的高山。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
The following spring, while on our way to Norfolk, Virginia, we were rolling through the Blue Ridge Mountains. For three days it had been raining heavily. We were at a point on a side of a mountain with a 200-foot drop on one side and craggy mountains towering on the other side. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当司机师傅刹车时，火车又一次摇晃起来。但这一次有一种不同的声音。他停在离山体滑坡不到12英尺的地方。经检查，这座桥有25英尺高，一个街区那么长。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Once again there was a jolt as the engineer braked the train. But this time there was a different noise. He had stopped less than a dozen feet from a landslide. On inspection, this proved to be twenty-five feet high and a city block long. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　在与其他列车员商量之后，司机师傅决定后退。就在这时，车尾发生了滑坡，离最后一辆车厢只有三十多英尺远。我们带上了手提行李，爬过泥泞的碎石、树根和岩石。当我们到达另一边时，一辆救援列车正在赶往救援。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After some consultation with the other trainmen the engineer decided to back up. Just then there was a landslide in the rear which didn't miss the end car by more than thirty feet. But we all got our hand luggage and climbed over the muddy rubble, tree roots, and rocks that covered the tracks. By the time we reached the other side a relief train was being rushed to our rescue. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　不久之后，在从纽约开往匹兹堡的快车上，我们的卧铺车厢停在了哈里斯堡，我们在那里玩了一个星期。乘务员九点叫醒了我们。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Not long after that, while on the New York to Pittsburgh express, our sleeping car was dropped off at Harrisburg where we were playing a week. The porter woke us at nine. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　当另一辆火车撞上我们的车时，我们几乎半裸的。我和Jingles被摔到下铺，打字机、妈妈的萨克斯和音乐盒都在我们周围哗啦一声掉到地板上。除了爸爸，没有人受伤，他正在系领带，正以完美的姿势抬起下巴，脸撞在了镜子上。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
All of us were about half-dressed when another train crashed into ours. Jingles and I were sent tumbling into the lower berth, and the typewriter along with Mom's saxophone and music case all crashed around us and to the floor. Nobody was hurt except Pop, who was just fixing his tie and was in perfect position with the chin lifted to mash his face against the mirror. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们和行李弄得乱七八糟，只好求助于乘务员和另外两名列车员才得以脱身。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We were so mixed up with the luggage that we required the help of the porter and two other trainmen to extricate ourselves. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　我们还没回过神来，一个位索赔代理人就冲了进来。“受伤了吗？”他问道。爸爸慢慢地说：“嗯，还不算太坏。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
We had hardly gathered our wits when a claim agent rushed in. "Hurt?" he asked. Pop said slowly, "Well, not too bad." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　没有等进一步的细节，索赔代理人急切地提出支付250美元以换取免责。爸爸接受并签署了免责书，索赔代理人似乎也很高兴付钱。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
Without waiting for further details the claim agent eagerly offered to pay $250 in exchange for a release. When Pop accepted and signed the release the claim agent seemed delighted to pay over the money. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　那天晚上的演出之后，这个男人来到我们的更衣室。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
After that night s show this man came to our dressing room. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“你们这些人拿了我公司的250美元，应该被逮捕。”他气急了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"You people ought to be arrested for taking $250 of my company's money," he spluttered. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“你在说什么？”爸爸问道。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"What are you talking about?" demanded Pop. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“我以为你在今天的火车事故中受伤了。但在看到你和你儿子在舞台上互相扔来扔去后。我告诉你，你应该被抓起来！”然后他离开了。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"I thought you were hurt in that railway accident today. But not after seeing you and that son of yours throw each other all over the stage. You ought to be arrested, I tell you!" and he left. 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　“下次你想把钱强加给别人的时候，”爸爸在他身后喊道，“等着看他们的表演吧。”
</summary><font color=gray><br>
"Next time you get that urge to force money on people," Pop yelled after him, "wait till you catch their act." 
</font></details>

<br>
<details><summary>
　　正如我所说，所有这些近乎灾难的事故都发生在两年内，而在其他的十六年里，我们没有再遇到过火灾或火车失事。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
All of these near catastrophies and accidents occurred, as I say, within two years, and we were in no other fire or train wreck during the other sixteen years The Three Keatons were in vaudeville.

　　当露易丝只有13个月大的时候，她就证明了她和我们一样很结实。我们刚搬进纽约埃里克二楼的房间，她就从一扇落地窗里走了出来，几乎把嘴从一个耳朵割到另一个耳朵，舌头也被割破了，下颌骨都被甩了出来。妈妈把她抱到街上，征用了一辆马车，火速把她送到医院。医生们把她的下颌骨按回臼内，把她的舌头缝好，她的舌头几乎被切成两半。露易丝经历了那场可怕的事故，没有口齿不清，没有任何其他语言障碍，甚至没有留下疤痕。
</summary><font color=gray><br>
When Louise was only thirteen months old she proved that she was indestructible as the rest of us. We had just moved into our second floor room at the Ehric House in New York when she walked out of a french window, cutting her mouth practically from ear to ear, gashing her tongue, and throwing both her jawbones out of their sockets. Mom carried her to the street where she commandeered a horse and buggy and rushed her to the hospital. The doctors massaged her jawbones back into their sockets and sewed up her tongue which had been all but cut in two. Louise came through that dreadful accident without a lisp, any other speech impediment, or even a scar.
