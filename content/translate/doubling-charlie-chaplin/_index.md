## 双倍查理卓别林（By J. REDMOND KEEGAN） 

　　对于一个严肃对待生活的喜剧演员来说，事情往往是不真实的。当发出“拍更大更好的电影”的口号时，很可能电影行业里只有一个人能真正认真对待它。矛盾的是，那个人是个喜剧演员——巴斯特·基顿。

<!--more-->

　　他不能一下子就动身。他认为，可以通过经验来学习，所以这是口号中“更好”的一半。&#8221;最后的应该在最前面&#8221; 你懂得，“更大”的事情要等到以后再说。

　　现在他的机会来了。他买下了查理·卓别林的工作室，《The Kid》就是在这里制作的，卡特·德哈文夫妇的作品也是在这里制作的。当然，在洛杉矶。

　　这个工作室被誉为有史以来最完整的小型工作室。这让巴斯特想到了更大的画面。

　　“如果你不扩大你的工作室，你怎么能把你的电影做得更大？”他问自己，但没有答案，断然没有答案，于是立即开始计划把工作室扩大。

　　他自己画了这个计划。他很清楚自己想要什么。虽然他的想法很清楚，但工人们似乎没有足够的想象力来理解他的计划。这导致我们需要一个常规的建筑师。

　　这造成了另一个困难。建筑师的计划对工人们来说非常清楚，但是巴斯特·基顿却无法解读。他不知道这些计划是否是他想要的。

　　“我立刻发现它们并不是我想要的，”他宣称。“我决定将工作室的规模扩大一倍。所以我数了已经到位的横梁上的所有螺栓，然后数了为新工作交付的螺栓。比已经交付的多出52个，所以我马上就知道他们把工作室扩大了两倍多。”

　　巴斯特立即提出抗议，并以螺栓的数量作为理由，认为计划不正确。他知道或者说他知道会有四个人来操作螺栓，每个人都坚持只会损失十三个螺栓，这就增加了52个螺栓，所以巴斯特决定接受这个计划。

　　他还决定亲自监督这项工作，确保按照他想要的方式进行。

　　“你看，我在上一次施工中注意到了。屋顶梁的各个部分钻了许多无用的孔。所以我坚持认为，如有必要，这些孔必须钻在梁的外面，而不是里面。我很难让工人们明白如何做到这一点。事实上，我必须穿上工作服并向他们演示。”

　　我很高兴我决定监督这项工作——事实上，我和工人们一起工作。我发现了工人们不满的一些主要原因，是最讨厌的制度，这些错误的制度如此牢固地灌输在他们身上，以至于他们实际上认为这是最好的办事方式。

　　例如，有一套系统是架设拱门来支撑屋顶。拱门是在地板上建造的，然后被吊起来，安装在已经就位的立柱顶部。这完全是错误的，拱门非常笨重，很难搬运。是用绳子吊起来会来回摆动。是的，只有经过最艰苦的工作，它们才能被安置到位。

　　现在我认为最好的系统是他们搭建帐篷的方式。先把拱门吊起来，然后把支撑物滑到末端下面，无论它们碰巧落在哪里。工人们跟我争论说，这将影响统一性。但我相信，如果尝试这种方法，可能会产生一种全新的建筑风格，也许会成为一种独特的美式风格!

　　另一件错误的事情是木匠们在同一地方锯木板的习惯——不是在木板上的同一个地方，而是在他们开始锯的地方。这意味着他们需要携带两块或两块以上的木材。现在，当我节省木材时，我只把一块带到我想用的地方，然后把它锯在那里。

　　当时我正在钉木板，在我锯完它们之后。我想到了一个绝妙的主意——我打算向我的嫂子建议，康妮·塔尔马奇(Connie Talmadge)，她刚刚进入园艺行业，把东西钉在一起的真正困难是开始钉的时候，所有手指都会受伤，诸如此类事情。

　　“现在我的想法既省去了所有的麻烦，也免去了锯这么多木材。我的想法很简单，就是把一棵松树和仙人掌灌木丛交叉，引导生长，这样在树上开花的松木板上就会长出仙人掌刺，在钉子被钉进建筑物的地方。因为仙人掌刺已经在那里生长了。这样就不需要用钉子了。

　　“当然，我意识到这可能需要两到三个季节。但我有很大的信心康妮能够完成它。据我所知，她从来没有种出过任何人种过的东西。”

　　但不管重建的困难有多大，它都快完成了，巴斯特再次展示了他的创意。他没有发出新工作室正式开业的邀请，而是在“恰好发生”的时候发出“盛大闭幕”的投标卡。

　　顺便说一句，工作中的工人们认为，巴斯特改造过程一直留在这里更重要的动机，那就是让他们保持良好的心情。

　　他们认为他在设计新的“特技”。

## Doubling Charlie Chaplin（By J. REDMOND KEEGAN） 

　　To a comedian who takes life seriously, things are apt to beliteral. When &#8220;Bigger and Better Pictures&#8221; Slogan went out, there probaly was just one of the motion picture industry who really took it serious. That one paradoxically, was a comedian, -Buster Keaton.

　　He couldn&#8217;t start all at once. He figured that through experience he would learn, so that accounted for the &#8220;better&#8221; half of the slogan. &#8220;The last shall be first,&#8221; you know. The &#8220;bigger&#8221; stuff had to wait until later.

　　His opportunity has come now. He has bought Charlie Chaplin&#8217;s studio, the same one in which &#8220;The Kid&#8221; was made, and which housed the Mr. and Mrs. Carter de Haven productions. Certainly, it is in Los Angeles.

　　Well, the studio has been complimented as being the most complete small studio ever built. That made Buster think about &#8220;bigger&#8221; pictures.

　　&#8221;How can you make your pictures bigger unless vou enlarge your studio?&#8221; he asked himself—and having no answer ready, he decided there wasn&#8217;t any, so immediately began plans for making the studio bigger.

　　He drew the plan himself. He knew exactly what he wanted. But while the idea was clear to him, the workmen didn&#8217;t seem to have the imagination to comprehend his plans. That resulted in calling in a regular architect.

　　That caused another difficulty. The architect&#8217;s plans were perfectly plain to the workmen, but Buster Keaton couldn&#8217;t decipher them. He didn&#8217;t know whether they were the plans he wanted or not.

　　&#8221;I discovered at once that they were not exactly what I wanted,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I decided to exactly double the size of the studio. So I counted all the bolts in the beams already in place and then counted the bolts that were delivered for the new work. There were fifty-two more delivered than were already in place, so immediately I knew that they were making the studio more than twice as large.&#8221;

　　Buster promptly protested, giving the number of bolts as a reason for believing that the plans were not correct. He learned—or says he did—that there would be four men handling the bolts and that each one would insist on losing just thirteen in order to give the bum&#8217;s rush to any hoodoo. that might be lurking in them. That accounted for th fifty-two extra, so Buster decided to accept the plans.

　　He also decided to supervise the work himself, to see that it was done the way he wanted it done.

　　&#8221;You see, I had noted, in the previous construction. that there were a number of useless holes drilled in various parts of the roof beams. So I insisted that these holes, if necessary, must be drilled outside the beams instead of inside. It was with difficulty that I made the workmen understand how this could be done. In fact. I had to put on overalls and demonstrate it to them.

　　&#8221;I am very glad I decided to supervise the work—in fact, work right with the men. I discovered some of the prime reasons for discontent among the workmen. It is the system employed that is most annoying and irksome to the men, and so soundly have these wrong systems been drilled into them that they actually think that it is the best way of doing things.

　　&#8221;For instance. there is the systern of erecting the arches for the support of the roof. These are constructed on the floor and then hoisted up and fitted into place on the top of upright posts that have already been placed in position. Now that is all wrong. The arches are very heavy and bulky to handle. They are raised by a rope and they swing around, and it is only after the hardest sort of work that they can be placed in position.

　　&#8221;Now the system that I think is the best is the way they put up a tent. Hoist the arch up first and then slip the supports underneath the end wherever they happen to land. The workmen argued with me that this would guard against uniformity. but I believe if it were tried—it might result in an entirely new style of architecture perhaps be the basis for a distinctly American style!

　　&#8221;Another wrong thing is the habit carpenters have of sawing up boards all in the same place—not the same place in the board but in the identical spot where they start. That means that they have two or more pieces of lumber to carry with them. Now when I saved lumber I carried just one piece to where I wanted to use it, and sawed it up there.

　　&#8221;It was while I was nailing&#8217; up the boards. after I&#8217;d sawed them. that a wonderful idea came to me—one that I intend to suggest to my sister-in-law. Connie Talmadge, who has just gone into horticuhure. The real difficulty of nailing thing together is getting the nail started. That&#8217;s where all the fingers get bruised and that sort of thing.

　　&#8221;Now my idea will do away with all that trouble, and will also do away with the necessity of so much sawing. The idea is simply this—to cross a pine tree with a cactus bush and guide the development so that a cactus spine will grow on each of the pine planks which blossom on the trees, in the places where nails would be used when they were put into buildings. Thus with the cactus spines already growing there. it would not be necessary to use nails.

　　&#8221;I realize, of course, that this might take two or three seasons of intensive training. but I have great confidence that Connie will be able to accomplish it. As far as I know, she has never yet grown anything at all similar to anything that anyone has ever grown before.&#8221;

　　But no matter what the difficulties of the remodeling were, it is nearly finished and Buster has again asserted his originality. Instead of sending out invitations for a formal opening of the new studio, he has issued bid cards for &#8220;a grand closing&#8221; whenever it &#8220;happens to take place.&#8221;

　　Incidentally, the workmen on the job figure. that Buster had a far more serious motive in sticking around during the remodeling that just keeping them in good humor.

　　They figure he was working out new &#8220;stunts&#8221;.
